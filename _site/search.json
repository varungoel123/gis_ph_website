I am not an IT person, but I did manage to install these software packages on both his Mac and Windows computers. You can contact me if you are having issues, but please also feel free to reach out to USC IT desk for assistance.\nPlease note that GEOG 510 will not rely on ESRI software (ArcGIS or ArcPro). Instead, we will be using open-source software such as QGIS and R. The reasons for this change are many, but the most salient ones are 1) ESRI software still does not run on Mac computers (without the need for partitioning or installing a virtual machine), 2) the newest version of ESRI’s GIS software (ArcPro) is not as intuitive and is clunky (and QGIS has basically closed the gap on functionality and usability), and 3) GIS programming is becoming a required skill for just about any GIS user. Regardless of whatever software is used, the knowledge you gain in this course should not be tied to a specific software package."

Try a search such as, study area health data statistics. For example, michigan health data statistics. Other strings can be used such as, michigan reportable diseases data statistics.\nIf you are study a place in the US, you may want to try to include a “geography” identifer in the search, such as maryland county health data statistics, which turned up this link and this link which both appear very promising.\nIf you’ve already found spatial data and are trying to locate tabular data for a particular subject, use a search string with the word table and the geographic resolution (unit) of your spatial data included, e.g., study area topic unit table. For example, you could search for, england vaccination local authorities table.\nYou can also try this type of search for “country or region” data and add the government entity that would likely collect or distribute the data.

    "text": "For this assignment, you will be working through a series of QGIS training modules, which are designed to get you up to speed on spatial data and representation, working with QGIS, and some basic GIS functionality. Working through these will be important so the class can move into some of the more advanced topics and uses of GIS by the end of the semester.\nI suggest that you complete each module assigned, but make your own decision on how much time to spend on each part given your prior GIS experience. For those of you with absolutely no GIS experience, I suggest diving in headfirst and working through every single step (time spent now will pay off later). For those of you with moderate to good GIS skills, make sure that you are at least skimming the reading within the module and completing all of the steps to brush up and ensure that you fill in any holes in your GIS knowledge. For GIS power users, I would suggest that (at the very least) you read through each module to make sure that you are familiar with all the operations and terminology included in each."

Feel free to use the following prompts to guide your answer: Did you find the interface and layout intuitive? Were any portions of the modules difficult to complete or understand? Do you now feel confident in your ability to add/load data layers? Did anything surprise you about working in QGIS?\n2. Module 4.1 (4.1.6) requires you to export the map you created as a graphics file. Export your map as a .jpg file and insert it into your answer document.\n3. In your own words (100-200 words), summarize and compare/contrast “Project on the Fly” in QGIS and changing/modifying the CRS of a spatial data layer (see Module 6.1).\n4. Module 6.2 required you to create multiple buffers (and use them to implement a distance-based analysis). Think of a health- or health care-related analysis where integrating buffers (or distance-based analysis such as that presented in 6.2) may provide useful/interesting results. Use the format in 6.2.2 to list potential criteria for your analysis.\n5. Now that you have had some initial GIS experience, describe a health-related research topic or problem that interests you and how you think GIS and/or geographic thinking can/should be integrated. This description can be mostly theoretical if you have no prior GIS/Geography experience. Try to stretch your ideas past simply “mapping the data” and descriptive analysis to consider how it can be used in explanation, prediction, or intervention.

    "title": "Data Storage and Management",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An important part of learning GIS is understanding how files and digital data are stored and accessed by the GIS software. This short demonstration attempts to point out some of the particularities that you will encounter as you download, store, and manage spatial (and other) data files both within and outside the GIS software.\nThe data are available here for download if you would like to follow along. Download the file GEOG510_demo1_data.zip to your hard drive (note where you downloaded the file!) and unzip it.\nNote that throughout this document, I use the term “right click”. This means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nSpatial Data Layers/Files\n\nUsing Windows Explorer (NOT Internet Explorer) on Windows or Finder on Mac, navigate to the unzipped contents of GEOG510_demo1_data, click on the folder Relational/spatial, and view the files. What you are seeing is a single spatial data layer (a common but hopefully dying format known as a shapefile). Notice that the “stem” of the file names is the same for each file (with different file extensions or types). The data format has its own internal logic and GIS software knows how to handle these files.\nOpen QGIS. In the top menu, select Project | New. Locate the Browser panel. This is basically a simplistic file/folder manager within the QGIS environment. Navigate to the folder Relational/spatial. Notice the difference in how QGIS displays the shapefile tl_2016_06_tract_alb.shp (compared to Explorer or Finder). Right click on the layer and notice that there are a couple of “file management” type options available. Choose Layer Properties. Click on each tab.\nYou can also use the Browser panel to view/preview some non-spatial data file types. Navigate to Relational/attributes, right click on CA_kind_0015_clean_TCT_AllData.csv, and choose Layer Properties. This functionality can be highly useful if/when you are searching for the right file to use or if you have multiple csv files and cannot remember which one you need to work with.\nNow, in the Browser panel, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Click the arrow next to CA_Vacc.gdb and note that it contains multiple layers (one spatial, one non-spatial). This spatial data type is called a geodatabase. It is like a container that can store multiple spatial data layers.\nIn Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Notice that, at a file system level, a geodatabase is simply a folder containing .gdb in the folder name! Also note that the naming and organization structure of a geodatabase is quite complex (and not easy to understand).\nGo back to QGIS and, in the Browser panel, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Click the arrow next to CA_vacc_geopackage.gpkg. This spatial data type is called a geopackage. It is like a container that can store multiple spatial data layers. This file has the same data contained within it as the geodatabase file.\nGo back to Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Notice that, at a file system level, a geopackage is a single file.\n\n\nWhy is this important?\nGiven the semi complex nature of file/folder storage for spatial data layers, is very, very easy to make the files unusable if doing file/folder management manually using Explorer or Finder. If possible, use the Browser panel in QGIS to perform basic file/folder management duties. If using Explorer or Finder, take care to move all folders/files associated with each layer.\n\n\n\n\nData (non)Storage in QGIS\nAnother extremely important aspect of using QGIS is understanding how GIS software interacts with spatial (and other) data layers when performing mapping and analysis. There are two extremely important concepts to learn,\n\nWhen you add a data layer to the Layers panel of QGIS, this is simply creating a link to where the layer is stored on your hard drive. The data layer does not move on your computer. The contents of the layer are not stored inside of QGIS. The software simply creates a link to the layer’s location.\nA QGIS project file (.qgz) can be used to save display properties, layer order, map layouts, and preferences… but it does not contain/store the actual spatial data layers.\n\n\nIn QGIS, add Object_Rel/CA_Vacc_geopackage.gpkg/tl_2016_06_tract_alb to the Layers panel using drag and drop from the Browser panel. If you get a pop up window asking about the geographic transformation, choose the default option. The layer should display in the map panel.\nIn the Layers panel, right click on tl_2016_06_tract_alb and choose Properties. If the Information tab (on the left) is not selected, click on it. Note that the Path to the file containing the data is shown (along with other basic information about the data). Click OK on the Layer Properties window.\nIn the top menu, choose Project | Save As. Save as File_paths_test.qgz in the Object_Rel folder.\nClose QGIS.\nGo to Explorer or Finder and navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Move the file File_paths_test.qgz from the Object_Rel folder to the Relational folder.\nOnce it is moved, double click on File_paths_test.qgz. You should get a pop up window named Handle Unavailable Layers. Click on tl_2016_06_tract_alb and click the Browse button. Navigate to Object_Rel and click on CA_Vacc_geopackage.gpkg. Click Apply Changes.\n\n\nWhat happened?\nWhen File_paths_test.qgz was moved on the hard drive, the link between this file and the data layers was broken. Remember, when adding a layer, QGIS only creates a link to the layer’s location. As such, if either the .qgz or the data layers file is moved, this link will be broken! QGIS uses relative file paths, meaning the data location are stored in relation to where the .qgz file is stored. In this case, as long as the file path between from the .qgz file to the spatial data layer files is not changed, the software will always be able to find the file.\n\n\n\nIn the top menu, choose Project | Save. Close QGIS.\nIn Explorer or Finder create a new folder called QGIS_test and move the Object_Rel and Relational folders inside of this new folder. Navigate to the Relational folder and double click on File_paths_test.qgz. What happened and why?"

    "text": "For data to be “spatial,” the observations must be explicitly tied to locations on the Earth’s surface. All spatial data has (or should have) a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), which describes the underlying system used to store location information in the data. Additionally, in QGIS, the Map Panel (canvas) has a CRS defined to display spatial data. It is important to understand that the CRS of the data and the Map Panel serve different (but linked) purposes.\nThe data for this demonstration are available here if you would like to follow along. Download the file GEOG510_demo2_data.zip to your hard drive (note where you downloaded the file!) and unzip it.\nNote that throughout this document, if I use the term “right click,” this means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nCRS of the Map Canvas\n\nOpen QGIS. In the top menu, select Project | New. Move your eyes to the Status bar, which is located at the bottom of the QGIS window. This area contains a decent amount of information about the properties of the Map canvas itself. Notice that, as you move the cursor within the Map canvas, that the location of the cursor is updated (Coordinate).\nNote that the Map canvas already has a CRS defined (bottom right of Status bar)! In this case, the CRS is EPSG:4326 (WGS 84).\n\n\n\nCRS of data layers\n\nIn the Browser panel, navigate to the folder GEOG510_demo2_data. Right click on the layer CA_tracts_albers located inside CA_tracts_albers.gpkg, and choose Layer Properties. In the Metadata tab, you can find the CRS information for this layer (EPSG:3310 - NAD83 / California Albers - Projected).\nRight click on the layer CA_vacc_15_wgs84.shp, and choose Layer Properties. Note that the CRS information for this layer is EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 - Geographic.\nIn Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder GEOG510_demo2_data. Right/control click on the file CA_vacc_15_wgs84.prj and choose Open With (or similar). On Windows, open with Notepad. On Mac, open with Text Edit. What’s contained in this file?\n\n\n\nWorking with CRS in QGIS\n\nDrag the layer CA_tracts_albers located inside CA_tracts_albers.gpkg into the Layers panel or directly into the Map canvas. You may get a pop up window asking about a Transformation for the layer. If so, click OK. Now, look at the Status bar. What happened? The CRS of the Map canvas was redefined to match that of the data layer.\nDrag the layer CA_vacc_15_wgs84.shp into the Layers panel or directly into the Map canvas. QGIS has projected this layer “on the fly” meaning that, although the data are stored in the WGS 84 CRS, they are being displayed in the California Albers CRS.\nIn the top menu, go to View | Panels | Processing Toolbox. Expand the arrow next to Vector geometry and then click Add geometry attributes. Note the options for Calculate Using! Choose one and click okay. What happened?\nIn the Layers Panel, right click on CA_vacc_15_wgs84 and choose Export | Save Features As. Note the options for CRS. Choose Project CRS. Save as CA_vacc_15_albers.gpkg in the GEOG510_demo2_data folder.\nIn the Layers Panel, right click on CA_vacc_15_wgs84 and choose Layer CRS. Note the options… one important one is that you can change the Map canvas CRS to match one the layers! Choose Set Project CRS from Layer. What happened?\nYou can also change the Map canvas CRS by clicking on the CRS information in bottom right of Status bar… or by navigating to Project | Properties!"

If it isn’t click the check box next to it, then click the Close button. Note that you now have an option for MMQGIS in the top menu!\n\n\nWhere’s my plugin?\nThe location of the functions/operations provided in a QGIS plugin varies by the plugin. For example, the MMQGIS plugin adds a completely new option to the top menu, whereas other may add a set of functions under a submenu such as Vector | PLUGIN. Generally, this information can be found on the plugin summary at Plugins | Manage and Install Plugins.\n\n\n\nGeocode data from a .csv file\nWithin QGIS, MMQGIS provides an option to geocode address locations stored in a .csv file. This is a pretty standard functionality provided by most GIS softwares.\n\nNavigate to https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8fc9c089c11a4913b0768381fa07bf6d_0. Click the Download button, scroll down to GeoJSON, and click the Download button. Save the file as MI_County.geojson to your hard drive (a great place to save would be your GEOG 510 folder).\nDownload GEOG510_demo3_data.zip here. A great place to save would be your GEOG 510 folder.\nAdd MI_County.geojson to the Layers panel. Shield eyes… ouch, that is a nasty CRS (we’ll deal with that later).\nIn the top menu, navigate to MMQGIS | Geocode | Geocode CSV with Web Service. Choose MIhospitals-for-geocoding.csv from the downloaded GEOG510_demo3_data folder as the input. QGIS attemps to find the correct fields for Address, City, and State (here, this was easy). For Web Service, choose OpenStreetMap / Nominatim. Note that the option to enter API Key does not work. For Output File Name, click the little button with three dots and Save As MIhospitals-for-geocoding.gpkg in the same location you saved the .csv file. For Not Found Output List, Save As MIhospitals-for-geocoding-notfound.csv in the same location you saved the .csv file. Click Apply. The process will likely take a few minutes. The result should be added to the Layers panel. How many of the hospitals were geocoded? Click ‘Close’.\nChange the CRS to Michigan GeoRef.\nOpen the attribute table of the geocoded layer MIhospitals-for-geocoding. Note the “display_name” and type” fields. These contain some important information about the quality of the results! Close the attribute table, then click “Zoom to Layer” on MIhospitals-for-geocoding. What do we notice? (use Identify tool)\nAdd MIhospitals-for-geocoding-notfound.csv to the Layers panel. These are the features that could not be geocoded."

How many were not?\n\n\nTable Join\nNote that NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded.gpkg only has location information. This isn’t super useful as/is. However, we do have the number of beds at each facility stored in a .csv file, which we can append to the geocoded locations using a table join.\n\nRight click on NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Joins. Click on the little green “plus” button at the bottom. For Join Layer, choose NC_Psych_Hosps_Beds. The key fields are the Join field and the Target field. Choose the correct fields for the join (ID and ID). Leave everything else unchanged and click OK.\nOpen the attribute table of NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and note the appended information!\n\n\n\nField Calculator\n\nRight click on NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Fields.\n\nQ2: What ‘Type’ is the “NC_Psych_Hosps_Beds_PSYCHBEDS” field stored as? Is this a nominal, ordinal, or an integer/ratio variable? If we were to calculate the average number of beds in NC hospitals using this field, would we able to do that or not? Why or why not?\nQGIS does not do a great job reading in data types in .csv files. Thus, the psychiatric bed information that was appended to the spatial features using the table join is not quite usable yet (beds are stored as character data)! In the next step, you will create a new numeric field in the NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded layer to store this information.Click the Field Calculator button (at the top, with colored dots on it).\n\nIn the Field Calculator window, make sure Create a new field is selected. In Output field name, put BEDS. In the Output field type, choose Whole number (integer 32 bit is ok). In the Expression area type or copy/paste: \"NC_Psych_Hosps_Beds_PSYCHBEDS\" (or find this in Fields and Values and double click the correct field). Click OK.\nOpen the attribute table of NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and note the appended information!\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Join\nQ3: By looking at the attribute table of NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded, can we determine the county that each facility is located in? Why would we need to use a spatial join here as compared to tabular join? \n\nIn the top menu, navigate to Vector | Data Management Tools | Join Attributes by Location. The “Join to features in” layer is the layer that will be “receiving” the information. The “By comparing to” layer is the layer providing the information. In this case, the “Join to features in” layer should be NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and the “By comparing to” layer should be NC_counties. For Features they (geometric predicate), intersect should be selected (this will assign information to each point from each polygon). In this case, you can simply create a temporary layer. Leave everything else as it is and Click Run.\n\nQ4: How many columns does the new joined layer has? (Note: you can take a look by right clicking the layer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Information and looking at the Fields metadata)\nQ5: Which county has the hospital with the highest number of beds?)\n\nNote that while we used the default QGIS tools for creating a new field and conducting joins, you can also the MMQGIS package which is even more intuitive.

    "text": "Part #1\n\nGeocoding\nIn the next section, you will be geocoding the location of Michigan acute care hospitals using two different geocoders. Then, you will perform both a table and spatial join to add attribute values to the hospital location data.\n\n\nGeocoding using an online geocoding service\nThe US Census Bureau provides a free, online geocoder for addresses in the US, Puerto Rico, and the US Island Areas. You can geocode up to 10,000 addresses per submission.\n\nNavigate to the Census Geocoder page. In the top menu, choose Find Locations | Batch Address Processing. There is a specific format you need to follow when submitting data (a csv file must not have a header row and must have the following fields: ID, Address, City, State, and Zip). Fortunately for you, I am a kind professor and have provided you with a file that conforms to this format. Click on the Browse button, and then choose MIhospitals.csv. The Benchmark should be Public_AR_Current. Click the Get Results button and save your geocoded output file in your data folder as MIhospitals_census_geocoded.csv.\n\n\n\n\nImport X,Y data into QGIS\nNow, you will convert the tabular data (containing the geocoded locations from the Census Bureau) into a spatial data file in QGIS. Remember, tables are not spatial data files… even if they contain spatial information. Some processing is required to define the numbers found in the tables as coordinate locations on Earth’s surface.\n\nThe output file from the US Census requires some light data wrangling before it can be read/used in QGIS. Open MIhospitals_census_geocoded.csv using Excel or some other spreadsheet-like software (but the instructions are based on Excel).\n\nQ1. How many records were not geocoded at all? Write down your answer in your word file\n\nInsert two new (blank) columns to the right of the field containing the coordinate locations (the coordinate locations should be in the F column if viewing the file in Excel). In the first row, in the first blank cell (cell G1), type =TEXTSPLIT(F1, \",\"), then hit the return key. If done correctly, G1 should contain the value before the comma in F1 and H1 should contain the value after the comma in F1. Copy/paste to the rest of the rows. Delete the formula from all rows without a value in F, e.g., F4, F79, etc.\nAdd a blank row above the first row and insert the following values in the new row (this will function as the header row or column names when importing):\n\nFAC_ID,ADDRESS,GC_RESULT,GC_TYPE,GC_ADDRESS,GC_LOCATION,LONGITUDE,LATITUDE,TIGER_ID,TIGER_SIDE\n\nSave the file and close Excel.\nOpen QGIS and create a new project. Open the Data Source Manager (button on the menu bar or in the top menu Layer | Data Source Manager). In the Data Source Manager, click on Delimited Text in the menu on the left. Use the following options:\n\nFor File name, use the three dots button and navigate to Mihospitals_census_geocoded.csv\nUnder Geometry Definition, make sure the LONGITUDE is selected for X field and LATITUDE is selected for Y field. For Geometry CRS, choose EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 (this is the CRS used by the US Census Bureau for the results).\nLeave all other options on their default settings, then click Add.\n\n\nYou should now see the points displayed in the map canvas and have a point layer called MIhospitals_census_geocoded in the Layers panel. This layer is simply held in temporary memory; thus, it is good practice to actually create a new permanent file that will store this layer.\n\nTo do so, right click on MIhospitals_census_geocoded and choose Export | Save Features As. Save the file as MIhospitals_census_geocoded.gpkg in your correct folder (it should be added to the Layers panel after you click OK). Remove the “csv version” of MIhospitals_census_geocoded from the Layers panel.\n\n\n\n\nGeocoding inside of QGIS using MMQGIS\nNext, you will geocode the same original data using QGIS.\n\nUse the instructions provided in the QGIS Plugins and Geocoding In Class Demonstration (#4) to install and activate the MMQGIS plugin.\nAdd MIhospitals_with_header.csv to the Layers panel in QGIS.\nIn the top menu, navigate to MMQGIS | Geocode | Geocode CSV with Web Service. Choose MIhospitals_with_header.csv as the input. QGIS attemps to find the correct fields for Address, City, and State (verify this worked). For Web Service, choose OpenStreetMap / Nominatim. For Output File Name, click the little button with three dots and Save As MIhospitals_osm_geocoded.gpkg. For Not Found Output List, Save As MIhospitals_osm_geocoded_notfound.csv. Click Apply. The process will likely take a few minutes to complete (just hold tight until you see the results appear in the Layers panel).\n\nQ2: How many records were NOT Geocoded using MMQGIS? Write your answer in the word file.\n\nAdd MI_counties to the Layers panel (it’s okay if you get a warning about the CRS!… it is just a warning). Arrange the layers so that the county polygons are not covering the points.\nChange the CRS of the map canvas to Michigan GeoRef (NAD83 / Michigan Oblique Mercator, EPSG:3078).\nNow would be a good time to save your project file, which saves your progress thus far. Go to Project | Save As and save your project as assignment2_geocode.qgs.\nUsing the Map Composer, make a map that highlights at least 3-4 locations that are different between the two geocoded results. Click here for the QGIS tutorial. Use the following for guidance:\n\nMake sure you choose symbols for the two hospital layers that are distinguishable.\nTurn on Labels for MI_osm_geocode layer (use the field, FAC_ID).\nUse the layer MI_Counties as the base layer for Michigan (use light fill and line colors)\n\nMake sure the map has a title, legend, scale bar, north arrow, and your name!\nMake sure that you try to make something that looks visually pleasing (colors are good, elements are aligned, layout is balanced, etc).\nWhen complete, export your map using userid_assignment2_map1.pdf.\n\nClose the Map Composer. Save your project file, then close QGIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Pre-processing\nWe often have to do a number of steps to make our data manageable and mappable. In the next section, you will remove extraneous information from the attribute table of the new spatial features you just created. Then, you will join information from a table to that file and create a map.\n\nOpen QGIS and create a new project. Add MIhospitals_census_geocoded to the Layers panel. Change the CRS of the map canvas to Michigan GeoRef (NAD83 / Michigan Oblique Mercator, EPSG:3078).\n\n\n\nDelete fields in attribute table\nIt is very important to note that the next step is a destructive editing step. It edits the original file and there’s no recovering the original information. If you are not sure that you are okay with this, make a copy of the original file first (right click on the layer in the Layers panel and choose Export | Save Features As).\n\nRight click on MIhospitals_census_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Fields. Click on the little button that looks like a pencil to toggle editing ON/OFF. Click on the fields that you want to delete (using control/command clicking)… in this case, you can delete GC_ADDRESS, GC_LOCATION, TIGER_ID, and TIGER_SIDE. When ready, click the Delete Field button (with a little red X). Click the button to toggle editing back to OFF. Save your edits. Click OK.\nNow would be a good time to save your project file, which saves your progress thus far. Go to Project | Save As and save your project as assignment2_tablejoin.qgs.\n\n\n\n\nTable Join\nA table join allows you to merge information from two separate layers/tables based on a common ID value. In QGIS, these can occur between/among spatial and non-spatial data layers. Table joins are one of most common data preparation steps using in GIS.\n\nAdd MI_hosp_attributes.csv to the Layers panel. This table contains the attributes that you will be joining to the features in the MIhospitals_census_geocoded layer. Open both attribute tables and inspect the available fields. Identify the key field you will be using for the join.\nRight click on MIhospitals_census_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Joins. Click on the little green “plus” button at the bottom. For Join Layer, choose MI_hosp_attributes. The key fields are the Join field and the Target field. Choose the correct fields for the join. Leave everything else unchanged and click OK.\nOpen the attribute table of MIhospitals_census_geocoded and note the joined fields. If you scroll down in the attribute table, you should notice that some of the hospitals have NULL values in the joined fields. This is because there was not a “matching” or “corresponding” entry for these features in the MI_hosp_attributes.csv file. This is okay for the purposes of this lab. However, it is good practice to always check the output of a table join to ensure that nothing fishy happened during the join. A simple way to do this when you have a lot of features (and you don’t feel like manually checking each of them) is to perform an attribute query on one of the joined fields. Close the attribute table.\n\n\nTable joins are not permanent\nA table join is not a permanent operation. The joined data only exists in temporary memory in QGIS. Sometimes this is a good thing… because you might only need the joined data for a single map or operation. Other times, you might be building a layer that you will need multiple times in the future. To make the join permanent, right click on the layer in the Layer panel and export as a new file.\n\n\nYou are required to make a Graduated Symbol map of Michigan’s hospital sizes. However, QGIS read in the attribute data for the hospitals as “character” data type rather than “numeric” (character data is not recognized as numeric). So, you will calculate a new numeric field for use in mapping.\n\nRight click on MIhospitals_census_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Fields. Click the Field Calculator button (looks like some colored dots). In the Field Calculator window, make sure Create a new field is selected. In Output field name, put BEDS. In the Expression area, type or copy/paste: to_real(\"MI_hosp_attributes_BEDS\"). Click OK.\nUsing the Map Composer, create a Graduated Symbol map of Michigan’s hospital sizes using the BEDS field (the number of beds at each hospital). Use the following for guidance:\n\nThe entire state should be on the map\nDo not use Labels.\nUse the layer MI_Counties as the base layer for Michigan.\nMake sure the map has a title, legend, scale bar, north arrow, and your name!\nMake sure that you try to make something that looks visually pleasing (colors are good, elements are aligned, layout is balanced, etc).\nWhen complete, export your map using userid_assignment2_map2.pdf.\n\nClose the Map Composer. Save your project file and then close QGIS.\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Join\nA spatial join allows you to transfer attribute information from one spatial layer to another based on shared location. In this section, you will be performing a spatial join to assign population data to a Zip Code layer for mapping purposes. This section also begins the process of illustrating how multiple operations must be performed to complete an analysis.\n\nSince you spent a lot of time creating a nice Michigan map layout in the previous section, you should use that hard work and effort again. Open QGIS and navigate to Project | Open, then open assignment2_tablejoin.qgs. Remove all the layers that were loaded in the Layers panel, then add the MI_zipcodes.gpkg and MI_block_pop.gpkg layers. The Zip Code layer is a polygon layer representing the areal extent of Zip Codes. The Block population layer is a point layer of the Census Block centroids and contains population information in the field POP (note: this layer has a lot of points in it, you may want to make it not visible). Go to Project | Save As and save the project as assignment2_spatialjoin.qgs.\n\n\nRecycling map layouts\nTo save time, I often spend a lot of time on my first “study area” map, especially if I know that I will be creating numerous maps of the same region. Then, I just reuse that project file and map composition (save with a new name) as a template.\n\n\nYou will now spatially join the population information in the MI_block_pop layer to the MI_zipcodes layer. This operation uses shared “location” to transfer attributes. In this case, each Zip Code will be receiving population information from the Block points that fall inside it.\n\nWe need a tool that is available in the Processing Toolbox to join and summarize information simultaneously. To open the Processing Toolbox, in the top menu navigate to View | Panels | Processing Toolbox. In the Processing Toolbox, under Vector General, double click on Join Attributes by Location (summary).\nThe Base Layer is the layer that will be “receiving” the information. The Join Layer is the layer providing the information. In this case, the Base Layer should be MI_zipcodes and the Join Layer should be MI_block_pop. Click the little wrench next to the Join Layer and change the option for Invalid feature filtering to Do Not Filter (there are a few Zip Code polygons that may cause this process to fail if not ignored). For Geometric predicate, intersects should be selected (this will assign information for points falling inside each polygon). For Fields to summarise, choose POP. For Summaries to Calculate, choose sum. Save as a new file, MI_zipcodes_pop.gpkg.\n\nOpen the attribute table of MI_zipcodes_pop. Note that there is now a field called POP_sum. This is the sum of the block population points falling in each Zip Code. Now, you will import hospital utilization data, join it to your new Zip Code layer (with population information), and calculate a new field containing the hospital utilization rate (We can call this a rate because it is utilization over a year).\n\nAdd MI_PD.csv to the Layer panel. The field PD contains the number of patient days spent in a hospital for residents of each Zip Code (measured during a calendar year). A patient day is equal to one person staying one night in the hospital. Use a table join (see Steps 19-20) to join the patient day table to the MI_zipcodes_pop layer you created in the previous step. After the table join, open the attribute table and verify that you now have patient days and population for each Zip Code.\nUse the Field Calculator to make the utilization rate calculation by dividing the number of patient days by the population for each Zip Code (see Step 22). In the Field Calculator window, make sure Create a new field is selected. In Output field name, put PD_rate. In the Output field type, choose Decimal number. In the Expression area, type or copy/paste: \"MI_PD_PD\" / \"POP_sum\". Click OK.\nUsing the Map Layout you already created in the Map Composer, create a Choropleth map of Michigan’s patient day utilization rate by Zip Code. Use the utilization rate field that you just calculated (PD_rate). Use the following for guidance:\n\nThe entire state should be on the map\nDo not use Labels.\nMake sure the map has a title, legend, scale bar, north arrow, and your name!\nMake sure that you try to make something that looks visually pleasing (colors are good, elements are aligned, layout is balanced, etc).\nWhen complete, export your map using userid_assignment2_map3.pdf."

Change the CRS to EPSG:32119, NAD83 / North Carolina on the fly.\nMake sure that your layers are arranged in the right order. All states in the background, followed by NC state boundary, followed by counties, and then tracts.\nNow, we will create map of the census tract areas in NC. To do so, navigate to the Tract layer and create a Graduated Symbols map for ALAND, which corresponds to the census tract land area in square meters.\nCreate a new print layout using the map composer.\nShow page properties and create custom page size to fit North Carolina’s shape (297 * 130 should suffice).\nAlign (center) the map frame to the page.\n\n\n\nBorder Transparency and Width\n\nNotice the default map.

Also write down the names of our group members. Note that while you can collectively discuss/work on answers with your group members, please submit your document individually.\nNote that throughout this document, if I use the term “right click,” this means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nDownload Data\n\nDownload the data here and unzip into your relevant geog 510 exercise folder. Add the tl_2022_45_bg.shp shapefile in QGIS that contains all census blockgroups (BGs) boundaries in South Carolina.\nOpen QGIS and Add Census Boundary Data\nOpen QGIS. Start a new project. Note the CRS of the shapefile and whether it a Geographic Coordinate System or a Projected Coordinate System. This will come in handy later.\n\n\n\nAdd, Prepare, and Join Demographic Data\n\nIn order to know the distribution of how many disadvantaged people are in each census BG, we need to incorporate demographic information in our analysis.\nThe relevant demographic information is provided in the file sc_bg_demographics.csv . GeoID is a unique census BG identifier, total_pop = population of each census BG, and poc_perc = % of disadvantage people in each BG.\nAs you input the file into QGIS, please be careful and consider appropriate field types. Think about which ones need to be a string, integer or decimal. Choosing the correct field types will save you a lot of headache later.\n\n\nField Types\nI recommend using the Data Source Manager in QGIS to read delimited text and assign correct field types to the csv file itself early in the process when you can. But you can also correct them after joining to your geospatial data as needed, although that can sometimes involve a larger number of steps.\n\nQ1.What field types did you select for your 3 columns of tabular data and why? (1-2 sentences)\n\nAttach the population information to the census BG file using tabular join. Note that when you conduct a tabular join in QGIS, the joined columns are temporary. To ensure that they are permanent, export the file to a new file named bg_pop.gpkg.\n\n\nAttribute/Tabular join in MMQGIS\nWhile you can use the tabular join using the default QGIS option, MMQGIS offers a convenient tabular join option too in MMQGIS -&gt; Combine -&gt; Attributes Join from CSV File. However, while it is very convenient, it is not good at reading missing values, and by default assigns those columns as strings (text). Regardless of any joins you use, MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR FIELD TYPES AGAIN.\n\n\nOpen the attribute table to ensure that the join was successful, and once you confirm, remove the sc_bg_demographics file and the original tl_2022_45_bg layers as they are no longer needed.\n\n\n\nAdd and Prepare Health Facilities Data\n\nNow add the scHealth_Facilities.geojson file to QGIS. You will be asked to choose an appropriate projection transformation formula since the file in WGS 84 GCS as compared to NAD 83 for the census BG file. Choose the first transformation. There are other potentially more accurate transformations too, but since the accuracy for all is between 4m to 1.5m, the choice of transformation does not matter as much for this exercise.\nExamine the health facilities dataset. Note that while this is an authoratitive dataset made available by SC DHE, it may not be directly usable for our analysis. Hence, before we can use this data, we need to make sure that we only include the relevant health facilties that are useful for our analysis.\n\n\nSelect by Expression\n\nFirst you will try to narrow down the number of health facilities that are registered in SC and are not tattoo or body piercing facilities. You can do so in multiple ways, but you will need to use the Select by Expression tool in some way. You need to select health facilities whose \"PERMIT_TYPE\" is not 'HLBODYPIERCINGFAC’ or 'HLTATTOOFAC'. In addition, you also need to select facilities whose \"LE_STATE_CODE\" is 'SC'.\n\nQ2.\n\nDescribe the process of subsetting your desired health facilities, including the exact expression(s) that you provided to Select by Expression tool. You can also breakdown your expressions and use ‘add to selection’, or use ‘invert selection’ as needed. Make sure to describe your process. Do not clear your selections as you will need them for your next question too.\nHow many facilities (out of 3185) did you end up selecting?\n\n\n\nSelect By Location\nQ3.\n\nYou will notice that there there are some facilties outside SC boundaries that have also been selected due to geocoding errors. To further refine our selection use the Select by Location tool under Vector -&gt; Research Tools. Copy paste a screenshot of your Select by Location window with your parameters.\nHow many facilities (out of 3185) did you end up selecting? These final selected facilities should be slightly lower than the ones that were selected in the previous question to account for out of state facilities\n\n\nExport the selected features to a new file called hf_selected.gpkg. Makes sure to choose the correct projection (NAD 83/ EPSG: 4269).\n\n\n\n\nConverting Census Geometry to Centroid\n\nBefore we calculate which census BGs are within 5 miles of a health facility we will first convert them from a polygon to their geometric centroids. Go to Vector -&gt; Geometry Tools -&gt; Centroids. Check ’Create centroid for each part’. Save the file as 'bg_centroids.gpkg'. Note that census tiger files have internal centroid coordinates stored as INTPLAT and INTPLON that can be used to create more accurate geometric centroids. But we do not need to worry about them here. MMQGIS also has functionality to create centroids.\nQ4.Why would we need to convert census BGs to centroids for our purpose rather than leaving them as polygons? What could be a potential limitation of using geometric centroids in this case? What could be a better way to measure a central feature that may be more representative? Answer in 3-5 sentences. It is ok if you do not have a perfect answer but think creatively and give it your best shot, as this would be an important workflow for your final projects.\nThere is a quirk in QGIS where the coordinate system may get undefined for the newly created centroids. To fix that, right click on bg_centroids layer –&gt; Layer CRS -&gt; select ‘EPSG:4269 NAD 83’.\n\n\n\nReprojecting and Buffering\n\nBefore we create 5km buffers for health facilities, we need to project our data into a projected coordinate system. Change the CRS of hf_selected to EPSG:32133 (SC Lambert Conformal Conic) and save the new file as hf_selected_proj.gpkg\nQ5.Why did we need to change the CRS? What could have potentially happened if we had not changed the CRS to a projected coordinate system? Think about the implications of the units of a Geographical coordinate system vs projected coordinate system. (1-2 sentences)\nNow, go to Vector -&gt; Geoprocessing Tools -&gt; Buffer, select hf_selected_proj as your input later, and distance as 5 kilometers or 5000 meters. Leave everything else as it is, and save the file as 'hf_5km.gpkg'.\nOptional: If you are confused about why we needed to change the CRS, try repeating 11. on the unprojected file hf_selected and see what happens.\n\n\n\nSelecting centroids within 5km of a Health Facility\n\nBefore we select the centroids, reproject bg_centroids to the same CRS (EPSG: 32133) and name the file as bg_centroids_proj.gpkg.\nNow use the ‘Select by Location’ tool, to select all census BG centroids that are within 5km of a health facility.\nQ6.How many census BGs (out of 3417) are within 5km of a health facility?\nClear your selection, and select centroids using the ‘Select within distance’ tool.\nQ7.How many census BGs (out of 3417) are within 5km of a health facility based on this tool? Is this number the same as the selection from Q6? Do not clear this selection as this will be used in the next steps.\nExtra Credit. Why might there be a difference in the number of centroids selected between the 2 methods?\n\n\n\nCalculating Proportion of Disadvantaged Populations within 5km of Health Facility\n\nUse the Show Statistical Summary tool on the selected features from bg_centroid_proj, and choose the \"sc_bg_demographics_poc_perc\" field.\nQ8. Examine the mean statistic. Report the value of the mean statistic. What does the value mean? Explain in 1-2 sentences.\nUsing field calculator, create a new field called n_disadv that calculates the number of disadvantaged populations in each BG. Uncheck the ‘Only update selected features’ checkbox. Keep the output type as Integer 32 bit. In the Expression Editor, enter the following query and press ok.\nround(\"sc_bg_demographics_total_pop\" * (\"sc_bg_demographics_poc_perc\" /100))\nTo make the new edits permanent, save the edits using the floppy drive icon in the top right (after the 2 pencil icons). Then click the yellow pencil icon to toggle off editing.\nUse the Show Statistical Summary tool on the selected features from bg_centroid_proj, and choose the “n_disadv\"field.\nQ9 a) . Examine the Sum statistic. Report the value of the sum statistic.b) Now choose the“sc_bg_demographics_total_pop” field and report the value of the sum statistic.\nUsing any calculator (windows/mac have one or you can also use the internet), do the following calculation:\n(Q9a / Q9b)*100\nQ 10) Report your answer. Is this number different than what you got in Q 8)? What does this number mean? Which one would you use to calculate the percentage of disadvantaged populations within 5 km of health facility and why?\nSubmit your word file with all your answers to your respective OneDrive folder."

However, there is no key field to do this join, so we must create one!\n\nField Calculator\n\nOpen the Field Calculator (either in the main view of QGIS or from the attribute table of Tracts_CB_500k_2010_NC). To create a GEOID field that matches the PLACES data, we will concatenate data from three fields to create a matching entry. Make sure that Create a new field is checked.

Make sure that the new field is Decimal type. The calculation is as follows:\n((100 - \"PLACES_2023_tract_NC_COLON_SCREEN\") / 100) *  \"PLACES_2023_tract_NC_TotalPopulation\" \n\n\nSelect Within a Distance\nNext, we will select tracts within 2 miles of each hospital location.\n\nIf the Processing Toolbox is not open, go to View | Panels | Processing Toolbox. In the Processing Toolbox, expand the arrow for Vector selection, and then select Select within distance. Choose Tracts_CB_500k_2010_NC for Select features from and the Hospitals layer for the By comparing to the features from. Uh oh… notice that Where the features are within (this is the distance) is defined in degrees. This is because the tracts data layer uses decimal degrees in its CRS. Click Close.\n\n\n\n\nMore Data Wrangling\n\nExport the Tracts_CB_500k_2010_NC layer as a new layer, but make sure to choose Project CRS: ESPG:32119… as the CRS!

If you have not installed GeoDa on your computer, do so now (for instructions, see the Software Document on the website).\nIf you want to follow along, the data are located here\nNote that throughout this document, if I use the term “right click,” this means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nLoad/View Data\n\nOpen GeoDa. Go to File | New (or click the button that looks like a folder) and load NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg. These data are incident cases of Lyme Disease by Zip Code over the years 2016-2018 in North Carolina.\nThe button to see the attribute table looks like a table and should be the fourth one from the right on the GeoDa toolbar. Open the attribute table for NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg. Note that each observation has a Zip Code, name, population count (pop20), and count of Lyme Disease cases over this period (cases).\n\n\n\nMap Rates\n\nGeoDa offers the ability to map rates based on two fields in the data table. Navigate to Map | Rates-Calculated Map | Raw Rate (or right click in the map area and choose Rates | Raw Rates). Choose cases for the Event Variable and pop for the Base Variable, and then change the Map Themes to Natural Breaks and the number of Categories to 5. Click OK.\nThe data you are viewing is for display only. To write the Raw Rates to the attribute table of NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg, right click in the map and choose Save Rates (you can leave the default name).\n\n\nTemporary Data\nMuch like QGIS, many of the operations we do in GeoDa are held in your computer’s temporary memory until you explicitly save them to the hard drive. For example, the field that you just added has not been permanently added to the NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg file! To finalize/save any changes you make to a spatial data layer (and attribute table) in GeoDa, in the top menu, choose File | Save. Do this now.\n\n\n\nNavigate to Map | Rates-Calculated Map | Excess Risk. hoose cases for the Event Variable and pop for the Base Variable, and then Click OK.\nChange the map to Rates | Empirical Bayes, and then write the rates to the table.\n\n\nField Calculator\n\nNext, calculate the difference between the Raw Rates and the Empirical Bayes Rates (to highlight wher they differ). To calculate a new field in GeoDa, in the top menu choose Table | Calculator. In the Calculator popup, change the tab to Bivariate. Click the button for Add variable and name the variable EB_diff and change Insert before to after the last variable. For the first variable, choose the EB Rate variable. For the Operator, choose SUBTRACT. For the second variable, choose the Raw Rate variable. Click Apply.\n\n\n\nSort Table\n\nOpen the attribute table. To sort the table by a specific column, double click on that column. Sort the NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg table by pop20 in decending order (biggest population to smallest). Look at the difference column. Scroll down and notice that the more people per Zip Code, the (generally) smaller the adjustment from the Raw Rate in the EB Rate calculation.\nTry to change the map type to Rates | Spatial Empirical Bayes. You should get a warning about not having a required weights file. This is because this method requires defining neighbors for each observation and you have not done this yet!\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhoods / Weights\n\nTo implement any spatial analysis in GeoDa, you must first identify a spatial neighborhood definition (to identify “what is near”). In GeoDa this is handled through the Weights Manager. Navigate to Tools | Weights Manager or click the “W” button in the GeoDa toolbar. This is where you can create a set of spatial weights or load weights you previously created for this data.\nUse zip_code as the ID Variable. Choose 1st order, Queen contiguity weights (should be the default). Click Create and save the weights to the same location as NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg. I suggest adding something about the neighborhood definition to the file name, e.g., NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Queen_1.gal. NOTE: you will get a warning about a neighborliness observation, that is okay!\nOnce you create the spatial neighborhood (weights), there are some options for exploring the nature of the connections via the weights manager. Note the histogram shows the distribution of the number of neighbors identified for each observation. The Connectivity Map and Graph are interactive maps that are quite interesting.\nCreate another set of weights using an Absolute Distance Threshold and compare them to the Queen contiguity weights.\nCreate another set of weights using k nearest neighbors and compare.\nCreate another set of weights using 2nd order Queen contiguity (but don’t include first order neighbors). Make sure to look at the Connectivity Map of this definition!\nNow, go back to your map window and create a map of the Spatial Empirical Bayes smoothed rates using either the 1st order Queen weights, the k nearest, or the Distance Threshold weights."

Open the provided QGIS project file.\nZoom to one of the layers, and take a look at the map. Does this look familiar? (Hint: Game of thrones and the true king of the Seven Kingdoms)\n\n\n\nKernal Density Estimation\n\nEach point in the death_nd_by_house is the location of households that were visited during the Cholera outbreak. Of interest is the deaths field in the attribute table that indicates the number of deaths (or no deaths) in each household during the Cholera outbreak. We will run Kernel Density Estimation on this dataset.\nSimilar to ArcGIS toolbox, QGIS has a powerful set of toolboxes available at your disposal. Navigate to Processing option in the top menu and and click on Toolbox. You can also click on the toolbox using the “blue wheel” icon (). Now navigate to Interpolation -&gt; Heatmap (Kernel Density Estimation).\nIn the heatmap window, choose the file containing location of deaths as your point layer. Choose the radius as 100 meters. Leave everything else as it is and press Run. It may take a minute or two for the analysis to run. Once it is finished, close the window.\nYou will notice a new grayscale raster file. This is the output of the Kernel Density Estimation. To make sense of it, right click the raster file, go to Properties -&gt; Symbology. Change the Render Type to Singleband pseudocolor. Choose the YlOrRd color ramp. Click classify and press OK.\nWhat do you notice? Does this support what you know about the 1854 London Cholera Outbreak?\nLet us re-run the KDE again. Open the Heatmap tool, select the correct Point Layer, and expand the Advanced Parameters option. In the Weight from field option, select the deaths field. This time save the layer in your folder as heatmap_weighted_100m.tif. Run the analysis and close the window once done.\nRepeat Step 6 on this newly created heatmap layer.\nWhat do you notice? Did the clustering of Cholera change? Is this pattern more in line about what we know about the 1854 Cholera outbreak? What do you think might explain the difference between the 2 heatmaps?\nNow you will experiment with both the radius and cell size parameters of KDE, and see how those parameters influence the patterns that you observe. Create 4 KDE surfaces of weighted cholera deaths.\n\nFor the first KDE surface, keep the radius to a distance between 10-30 meters, and Pixel size of 1 or less for both X and Y. It should be the same for both X and Y. So for example if you chose 1 as your pixel size, this denotes that each pixel will be 1*1 sq meters. Save this KDE as heatmap_r[your radius]_px[your pixel size].tif.\nFor the 2nd KDE surface, keep the radius to the same distance as before, but change Pixel size to a number between 10-50 meters. Save this KDE using the above file format.\nFor the third KDE surface, keep the radius to a distance between 250-400 meters, and Pixel size of 1 or less for both X and Y. Save this KDE using the appropriate file format.\nFor the 4th KDE surface, keep the radius to the same distance as before, but change Pixel size to a number between 10-50 meters. Save this KDE using the above file format.\n\nAdjust the color scheme as you did for earlier heatmaps. Paste all of these 4 heatmaps along with a description (maximum 100 words) of how changing the radius or cell size influences the interpretation of the spatial distribution of cholera. For this exercise you can simply take screen shots of your heatmap (you dont need the legend). Save the word file as `yourusername_ex6.docx’ into your relevant OneDrive folder."

Open a word doc, save it as ‘youruserid_ex7.docx’ and answer the following questions.\nNote that throughout this document, if I use the term “right click,” this means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nData\n\nDownload the data here and unzip.\n\n\n\n\nOpen GeoDa and Load Data\n\nOpen GeoDa. Create a new project and load data by navigating in the top menu to File | New (or click the button that looks like a folder) and choosing NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg from the exercise7 data folder (or by dragging the file into the specified area from Finder/Explorer). This layer contains incident cases of Lyme Disease by Zip Code over the years 2016-2018 in North Carolina.\nThe button to see the attribute table looks like a table and should be the fourth one from the right on the GeoDa toolbar. Open the attribute table for NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg. Note that each observation has a Zip Code, name, population count (pop20), and count of Lyme Disease cases over this period (cases).\n\n\n\n\nMap and Calculate Incidence Rate\n\nNavigate to Map | Rates-Calculated Map | Empirical Bayes (or right click in the map area and choose Rates | Empirical Bayes). Choose cases for the Event Variable and pop for the Base Variable, and then change the Map Themes to Natural Breaks and the number of Categories to 5. Click OK. Take a screenshot of this map and paste it in your word file. It will come handy when answering questions later.\nWrite the Empirical Bayes Rates to the attribute table of NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg, right click in the map and choose Save Rates (you can leave the default name).\n\n\n\n\nDefine Neighbors\nPrior to completing any spatial autocorrelation analysis, we need to define our neighborhood (allows us to compare between things that are “near”).\n\nClick the Weights button on the toolbar (the big W) or navigate in the top menu to Tools | Weights Manager. In the Weights Manager popup window, click Create (since we don’t have any created yet). Use zip_code as the ID Variable. Choose 1st order, Queen contiguity weights (should be the default). Click Create and save the weights to the same location as NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Queen_1.gal in the exercise #9 data folder. NOTE: you will get a warning about a neighborliness observation, that is okay!\nGeoDa provides some basic information and a few tools to explore the nature of the neighborhood definition via the weights manager.\n\nQ1. What is the average number of neighbors given 1st order, Queen contiguity?\n\n\n\nGlobal Spatial Autocorrelation\nWe use global spatial autocorrelation metrics to answer the question, “considering all the observations (values), is the overall pattern clustered, random, or dispersed?” You will now answer this question for Lyme Disease incidence rates in NC.\n\nCalculate Moran’s I. To do this, in the top menu, click on Space | Univariate Moran’s I. Choose R_EBS (Empirical Bayes smoothed rates) as the First variable, as we are testing the spatial pattern of the rates of Lyme Disease. Make sure NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Queen_1 is selected for the weights. Click OK. NOTE: Because some of the tracts do not have any contiguous neighbors, you should get a warning stating this. This is okay.\nYou should get a popup window containing a Moran’s I scatterplot with the Moran’s I value at the top. To run a hypothesis test (and get a p-value) comparing the results to a null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness (CSR), right click anywhere inside the Moran’s I window and choose Randomization | 999 Permutations. You should get another popup window that contains the pseudo p-value based on the value of your data compared to the random permutations.\n\nQ.2 What is the Moran’s I value and pseudo p-value? What is your interpretation of this output? (less than 100 words)\n\n\n\nLocal Spatial Autocorrelation\nWe often want to understand spatial autocorrelation at a regional level. We use local spatial autocorrelation metrics (e.g., LISA, Getis Ord G*) to accomplish this. These methods produce a measure of autocorrelation for each observation in your data, thus allowing you to identify hotspots and coldspots, as well as spatial outlier values.\n\nIn the top menu, click on Space | Univariate Local Moran’s I. Choose R_EBS (Empirical Bayes smoothed rates) as the First variable, as we are testing the spatial pattern of the rates of Lyme Disease. Make sure NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Queen_1 is selected for the weights. Click OK. You will get a popup window asking “What windows to open?”. Make sure that all options are selected and click OK.\nRight click in one of the pop up maps. Change the Significance Filter from 0.05 to 0.01. Note that the number of Zip Codes highlighted in both maps change!\n\nQ.3) Paste this map (screenshot is ok) into your word file. How many Zip Codes were identified as being in a High High cluster? How many in a Low Low cluster? Provide a short explanation (less than 100 words) of why one would expect the pattern of High High observations and Low High outliers given the original choropleth map?\n\n\nNow, create a new set of weights using a choice of distance weights (distance threshold or K-nearest neighbors. For distance threshold, make sure to choose a distance above the minimum threshold, and for K-nearest neighbors, choose a number between 4-10.\n\nQ4-6. Answer Q1-3 again but using the new chosen weights.\n\nSave your file with your answer and upload to your relevant OneDrive folder."

    "section": "Overall Project Paper Goal",
    "text": "Overall Project Paper Goal\nFor your final project paper, you are required to implement an analysis that leverages GIS and spatial analytic techniques to answer a health-research question. There is no minimum or maximum number of operations you need to perform in your analysis, but there are some general principles that you should follow. Here are also 3 examples of past projects from another version of this class to provide you some idea. Please note though that some requirements for our class may be different than what was required for these sample projects.\nExample Project Papers (PP):\nPP1: Landuse and rodent inspections\nPP2: Lead and Private wells\nPP3: Medicaid network suitability for OB/GYN facilities\n1) You should have a main research question that is related to a health-related outcome, AND also focuses on investigating the role of the underlying process(es) that may have generated the spatial distribution of the health-related outcome that you are interested in. My general advice for this project is aim for a focused, tight, organized, and rigorous analysis, than focusing on a complex question. Infact, I would much rather you ask a simple question and answer it very well than have you ask an awesome question and not do a very good job of answering it. The 3 PPs all have good, feasible research questions that could be answered using tools learned in the class.\n2) Your analysis should include some of the descriptive statistics and maps that we have learned in class. The purpose of these is to describe to the reader, important summaries and spatial distribution of variables related to your research question. Take a look at PP2. Figure 1-4 are good examples of descriptive maps, and section 3.1 is a good example of descriptive statistics. Similarly, in PP3, notice how they use network analysis to describe service areas.\n3) Your analysis should include some of the exploratory GIS and spatial analysis techniques that we have learned in class. These are techniques that help you identify patterns objectively in your datasets so that you can begin to think about what may be the underlying processes that are driving those patterns that you observe. Ideally, you would incorporate atleast some global and local autocorrelation analysis in your project to identify important patterns and hypothesize about underlying processes. All three example papers use Global and Local Moran’s I to conduct exploratory analysis.\n4) Ultimately, your main research question should to be explanatory in nature, in an attempt to understand, at least on some level, the process generating the spatial pattern(s). This is where you start generating or testing evidence of whether/how certain processes might generate the spatial pattern of the health outcome that you observe. A good example of this analysis is PP1 and PP3. In PP1, the authors use spatial regression to examine whether certain landuse characteristics may be driving rodent inspection rates. IN PP3, they assess whether being in a service area may be linked to medicaid enrollment.\nThere may be some exceptions to this rule. For example, you may be interested in prediction (such as predicting infectious disease incidence in vulnerable areas during an outbreak) , and not explanation. However, even predictions need to be informed by an understanding of processes driving existing patterns. Similarly, some of you may be interested in an intervention. An example is PP2, where the authors try to identify sites with high proportion of private wells and lead risk that should be prioritized for water infrastructure modernization. However even these studies are based on underlying theory about processes (eg. lead being a problem in private wells and caused by old water infrastructure).\n5) Ultimately, I understand that these requirements will be different for everyone’s particular project, so please talk with me, if you have any doubts or questions. If you leave everything towards the end, there is no guarantee that I will be able to help you in my full capacity."

    "section": "Section Content",
    "text": "Section Content\n\nIntroduction\nProvides a broad overview of the health topic and why it is important (think “big picture” here). Aim for roughly 2-3 paragraphs for the first part of this section. Think of your Introduction as a funnel… start with big ideas and use each paragraphs to narrow down to a problem statement and research question. Your research question should be extremely easy for me (the reader) to identify.\n\nBackground\nThis section falls directly between the Introduction, which should build to your problem statement and research question, and the Materials and Methods, which explains data and method(s) you used to answer your research question. The Background should function as a bridge between these two sections. By reviewing the previous literature, you will be providing additional context to the Introduction content and providing important foundational information that will assist the reader in understanding the motivation or justification for your work (for some, this section also might require a review of your overall analytical approach– but not a deep dive into the methods). Aim for roughly 2-3 paragraphs for this subsection.\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nThis section will likely be split into Data and Preprocessing and Methods. In GIS-based analysis, it is often the case that there were a number of operations performed to get the data ready for the actual analysis. In a sense, these are not “methods” because they were not analytic methods used to answer the research question. Sometimes, this line is blurry; however, generally, it is pretty easy to separate out what was preprocessing and what was analysis.\n\nData and Preprocessing\nThis section should have link(s) or references to where you acquired the data from. You do not have to provide every single minute detail of the pre-processing steps, but should provide enough detail that another person could reasonably reproduce what you did to acquire and prepare the data for analysis.\n\n\nMethods\nHere, detail the analytic method(s) that you used to answer the research question. Don’t be afraid to use signposts back to your research question(s) here, e.g., “To answer this or that… I used this method”. Include your global and local spatial autocorrelation methods here, as well as the method/techniques that you used to answer your main research question.\n\n\n\nResults\nPretty self explanatory. Again, don’t be afraid to use signposts back to your research question(s) here, e.g., “The results of this test answer our question of this or that”. Keep this section straightforward, e.g., save any larger discussion or explanation of what the results “mean” in a broader sense for the following section.\n\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nYou can separate these sections or combine them. Here is where you can expand upon the broader implications of your results or to compare your results to results from previous studies. You can also use this area to discuss “future research” (not required, but recommended). You should also use this area to critically discuss “limitations” of your analysis. These could be due to data issues, MAUP, not being able to use a more sophisticated method, etc. Wrap up your paper with a short summary of the main takeaways from your analysis.\n\n\nReferences\nList your cited literature."

Good places for this are in the Introduction after the Research Question or in the Discussion and/or Conclusions section. Basically explain why your analysis is 1) different / better / more interesting than a non-spatial analysis would be and/or 2) why GIS processing/analysis is so important to being able to ask/answer your Research Question.

Keep in mind that maps are figures! You should have at the bare minimum one map, but I would suggest making multiple maps (e.g., one of your main outcome variable, one of your LISA/SaTScan results). Make sure to design your map(s) for the medium… a portion of a 8.5”x11” piece of paper (please try to stay away from making “full page” figures). I will be evaluating things like text size and design of your map(s).\nAbsolutely no screenshots of ArcGIS or statistical software output!\nPlace the figures or tables “inline” (in the body) of the paper. Do not use text wrapping! Every figure and/or table must have a figure/table number and a short, descriptive caption. Do not use floating text boxes for captions! Every figure/table included in the paper must be referenced in the main body of the text, for example:\nDiabetes prevalence appears to be much higher in the southeastern states of the US (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1 shows that diabetes prevalence is highest in the southeastern states of the US."

I like to use numbered sections and subsections, but you do not have to do this.\nYou must cite, at a minimum, 8 papers or reports. Use any format you prefer for citing information in the text. All I ask is that you be consistent throughout your paper and make sure that everything you cite in the text is correctly referenced in the References section of the paper.\nThe body of your paper, which includes everything but the References, should be a minimum of 2,000 words and a maximum of 3,000 words. This roughly translates to 8-12 double spaced pages, given the formatting requirements above. However, please use the word limits I have provided, rather than the page limits, as everyone’s writing style is a bit different and the inclusion of figures/tables throws page limits off. A long paper does not necessarily mean a good paper, so do not “stretch or pad” your writing or include extraneous, unnecessary, and/or superfluous content. I am a fan of clear, organized, and coherent writing. So, please do not “pad” your writing with extra words in an effort to make your paper longer.\nCreate a single word-processed document.

    "text": "This exercise walks you through a cluster analysis in SaTScan. If you have not installed SaTScan on your computer, do so now (for instructions, see the Software Document on Canvas).\nIf you want to follow along, the data are located here. We will be working with the Lyme Disease incidence data for this demonstration.\nNote that throughout this document, if I use the term “right click,” this means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nPrepare SaTScan\n\nOpen SaTScan and choose Create New Session. Navigate to the Analysis tab. We are working with cross-sectional data, so we will be performing a Purely Spatial Analysis. Our probability model is Poisson because we are working with Lyme Disease cases. In this case, we want to scan only for clusters having High Rates.\nClick on the Advanced button and navigate to the Spatial Window tab. This is where you can set the “maximum” spatial size of the identified clusters and can choose between Circular and Elliptic cluster shapes. For this analysis, we will keep things simple and leave them on their default values, but knowing where to change these values is important. Click Close.\nClick the Input tab. Here we have to import a Case File. We will use the .dbf file (attribute table) from a shapefile version of the Lyme Disease data. Click the button with the three little dots for Case File and select NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.dbf. Click Next. In the popup window:\n\n\nChoose ZIP_CODE for Location or Identifier\nChoose CASES for Number of Cases\nClick Next, then click Next again\nSave the imported input file as NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.cas, then click Import.\n\n\nClick the button with the three little dots for Population File and select NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.dbf. Click Next. In the popup window:\n\n\nChoose ZIP_CODE for Location or Identifier\nChoose POP20 for Number of Cases\nClick Next, then click Next again\nSave the imported input file as NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.pop, then click Import.\n\n\nClick the button with the three little dots for Coordinates File and select NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.shp. Click Next. SaTScan loves working with geographic point data, so it calculates the centroids of the polygons for you. In the popup window:\n\n\nChange the top option to Cartesian …\nChoose ZIP_CODE for Location or Identifier\nChoose Longitude / X for X and Latitude / Y for Y\nClick Next, then click Next again\nSave the imported input file as NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.geo, then click Import.\n\n\nClick on the Output tab. Write the Main Results File to NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Clusters.txt. Make sure the little boxes are selected for all options under dBase. Click on Advanced and explore options (especially overlap!).\n\n\n\n\nRun SaTScan\n\nTo run SaTScan, click the little green triangle button (near the top of the main SaTScan window). Another way to do this is to go to the top menu and choose Session execute.\n\nWhen SaTScan is done, NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Clusters.txt will pop up. This file contains some basic information about the input data and resulting clusters, as well as the members of and statistics for each cluster. Scroll to the top and note the nature of the output. In this case, we want to map our output, so we will be working in QGIS to do that. See the SaTScan Users Guide for more detailed information about the potential output options and what is included in each file. Prior to closing SaTScan, save your session.\n\n\n\nCreate Mappable Data from SaTScan\n\nOpen QGIS and create a new project. Add NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.shp. Diplay Case Rate variable.\nAdd NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Clusters.col.dbf to the QGIS Layers panel (you can drag/drop). This file contains information about the center, size, and statistical attributes of each of the clusters identified in SaTScan.\nCreate a temporary point layer of the cluster centers. In the Processing Toolbox, navigate to Vector creation | Create points layer from table. For the Input layer choose NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Clusters.col. Select the appropriate fields for X (X) and Y (Y), and make sure that the CRS is EPSG:32119 click OK. These are the center points of the clusters.\nOpen the attribute table of the output. Note that some “clusters” are single observations. Also, note that the p-value for some of the clusters is above our general threshold for statistical significance.\nUse an attribute query to select only points with a RADIUS greater than 0 and a p-value less than or equal to 0.05.\nto Vector | Geoprocessing Tools | Buffer. For Input layer, choose the “Points from table” file. Make sure that Selected features only is checked! For Distance, click the little button all the way to the right (next to the word meters) and choose Field type: … | RADIUS (this is the variable distance!). Leave everything else on the default value (including Dissolve result), and then click Run.\nInstall and activate the “Select Within” plugin. Go to Vector | Select Within | Select Within. Use this tool to select and then export the Zip Codes falling within the high clusters. Use the Centroid option. We use this selection method because centroids are what were used to define the clusters in SaTScan!\nIn case you have issues creating files in this demo, you can also download the data with all generated files from this demo here."

    "text": "Part #1: Using Spatial Overlay and Learning Some New Tricks in QGIS\nIn this example, you will use census block group (BG) data to assign population estimates to Zip Codes (i.e., you have a polygon file of South Carolina Zip Codes, but they do not have population assigned to them). There are multiple approaches to doing this operation; the one you will implement requires “distributing” the population of each Block Group to the Zip Code(s) it falls inside based on the proportion of the BG area falling in each Zip Code. For example, if 1/3 of a BG’s area falls in one Zip Code and 2/3 of its area falls in another, we would use those proportions to allocate the population from the BG to the Zip Codes. This is a pretty straightforward procedure, but will require an overlay operation (Intersect), a couple of field calculations, some table manipulation, and a table join.\n\n\nLoad Data and Calculate New Field Based on Geometry Properties\n\nOpen QGIS and create a new project. Add sc_bg_pop.gpkg and sc_zipcodes.gpkg from the assignment3_data/SC folder to the Layers panel. It would be a great idea to save/name your project file now so you can come back to it later if necessary. Note: Also, dont worry about the jutting out coastline in the sc_bg_pop layer.\n\n\n\nPrior to adding a new field with attributes based on geometry, you can set which units you want QGIS to use. For example, in the following example, we want area to be returned in square kilometers and distance to be returned in kilometers. In the top menu, navigate to Project | Properties. On the left, click on the General tab and find Measurements. Change the distance and area units to kilometers and square kilometers (then click OK).\nAdd a new field containing each BG’s area to the sc_bg_pop attribute table by first opening up the layer’s attribute table. Next, use the field calculator to add a new Decimal number field called BGAREA, with the following expression: $area. Make sure to save your edits and close the attribute table after you have confirmed that the new field has been populated.\n\n\n\nQuestion #1: What is the maximum area for any BG? How/where did you find this information?\n\n\n\n\nIntersect\n\nYou will now create the new spatial features based on shared geometry (overlap) of the Zip Code and Block Group boundaries. In the top menu, navigate to Vector | Geoprocessing Tools | Intersection. For the Input layer select sc_bg_pop, and for the Overlay layer select sc_zipcodes. There is an issue with geometries in sc_zipcodes, so you will fix it before you can run the intersection. To do so, click the  “wrench” icon next to the overlay layer and select “Do not Filter (Best Performance)“.\nSave the output as sc_bg_zip_int.gpkg in your assignment3_data/SC folder. Leave all other options on their default settings. Click Run.\nOnce complete, zoom in a bit and click sc_bg_zip_int on and off so you can see either sc_bg_pop or sc_zipcodes underneath. What do you notice? I notice that sc_bg_zip_intlooks a bit “messy” because these two sets of areal units do not hierarchically nest. Open the table of sc_bg_zip_int. You should notice that these intersected polygon features have the attributes of both input files! For each polygon in this layer, you know its Block Group and Zip Code “membership.”\n\n\n\nQuestion #2: How many polygons were created in the “intersected” layer?\n\n\n\n\nCalculate Area Again and Allocate Population\n\nTo allocate the population for each BG, we need to calculate the proportion of the area of the BG that is located in each Zip Code. First, we need to add a new field to sc_bg_zip_int with the area of each polygon. Then, we will use the field calculator to perform the allocation.\nFollow Step 3 to add a new field in sc_bg_zip_int with the area of each polygon (call this field BGZIPAREA).\nAdd a new Decimal number field named ZIPPOP to sc_bg_zip_int using the Field Calculator. This field will contain the formula Population * (Intersect area / Total area) for each Tract/Zip intersected polygon. The expression is: \"POP\" * ( \"BGZIPAREA\" / \"BGAREA\" )\n\n\n\n\nAggregate the Zip Code Population\n\nNow, because multiple block groups contribute to each Zip Code’s population (open the attribute table of sc_bg_zip_int and sort it by the ZipCode field), we need to aggregate the allocated BG population to the Zip Code level.\nGo to the Processing Toolbox | Vector Analysis | Statistics by categories. For Input vector layer, choose sc_bg_zip_int. For Field to calculate statistics on, choose ZIPPOP (this is the field we will be summing). For Field(s) with categories, choose ZipCode (this is the field that contains the groups we will sum over). For the output, you can simply write as a temporary file because you won’t need it after the next step.\nOpen up the output table (should be called Statistics by category unless you gave it a different name). Note the various statistics for each Zip Code. The important one here is sum which contains the sum of the BG population falling in each Zip Code (by area proportion).\n\n\n\nQuestion #3: Which Zip Code has the highest population? What is the population of the Zip Code with the highest population?\n\n\n\n\nTable Join, One More Field Calculation, and Make a Map\n\nYou’re almost done with the first part of the assignment. The remaining task is to create a choropleth map of population density by Zip Code in South Carolina. However, to complete this, you’ll need to implement the following steps (that you should already know how to do!) in order:\n\n\nTable join the Statistics by category table to the Zip Code spatial features\nCalculate a new field with each Zip Code’s area\nCalculate a new field containing population density (People per square kilometer)\nMake a choropleth map of population density. Consider this an “internal” map, which means that it does not have to be pretty, but needs to be functional: make sure that the geographic extent is correct, you have chosen an appropriate color scheme, and include a title, legend, and your name. Export the map as a .pdf file using the userid_assignment3_map1.pdf."

    "section": "Part #2: Spatial Clustering/Autocorrelation Analysis",
    "text": "Part #2: Spatial Clustering/Autocorrelation Analysis\nIn this portion of the assignment, you will be performing a variety of global and local clustering and autocorrelation operations using personal medical exemption (PME) data in 2015 in California (Data made available courtesy Dr. Paul Delamater). Personal medical exemption is used as a proxy to evaluate vaccine hesitancy or lack of vaccination. This analysis will provide us with quantitative information regarding the spatial patterns of medical exemption use in California. You will be comparing the autocorrelation/clustering output from GeoDa and SaTScan and making maps using QGIS. One of the things you will also be examining is the effect of neighbor definition on spatial clustering results.\n\n\nOpen GeoDa. Create a new project and load data by navigating in the top menu to File | New and choosing CA_TCT_ME_2015.gpkg from assignment3_data/CA (or by dragging the file into the specified area from Finder/Explorer). This layer contains the number of kindergarteners enrolled in 2015 and the number claiming a medical exemption (ME) for census tracts in California. This layer was created from school-level data using a spatial join of schools to tracts.\n\n\n\nCalculate a New Field in GeoDa\nGeoDa is not really a GIS software, but it does have a number of GIS-like capabilities, such as displaying/mapping data and manipulating data layers. In this case, you will use GeoDa to calculate a new field.\n\nOpen the attribute table of CA_TCT_ME_2015 by clicking the Table button on the GeoDa toolbar. Notice that this only contains the count values for enrollment and MEs. To perform our first operations, we will need ME rates (proportions). In the top menu, choose Table | Calculator. In the popup window, select the Rates tab. We will be using the raw rate of MEs for each tract, so make sure Raw Rates is selected as the Method. On the left, click the button for Add Variable because we need a new field to hold our calculated values. In the popup window, name the variable PME15R, Type should be real, Insert before should be set to “after last variable”. Leave the rest of the options on their default settings. Click Add. Choose pme15 as the Event Variable and enr15 as the Base Variable. Click Apply.\nMap the new variable you calculated by right-clicking inside of the GeoDa map window, selecting Change Current Map Type | Natural Breaks | 5, and selecting PME15R. You should now have a choropleth map of PME15R (personal medical exemption rates in 2015).\n\n\n\nTemporary Data\nMuch like QGIS, many of the operations we do in GeoDa are held in your computer’s temporary memory until you explicitly save them to the hard drive. For example, the field that you just calculated (PME15R) has not been permanently added to the CA_TCT_ME_2015 file! To finalize/save any changes you make to a spatial data layer (and attribute table) in GeoDa, in the top menu, choose File | Save. Do this now.\n\n\nProject Management in GeoDa\nThe project management in GeoDa is also similar to QGIS in that you can save the “work” you’ve done as a “project” file. This is somewhat similar to saving a project in QGIS. To save your project, in the top menu, choose File | Save Project. Do this now and save your project as GEOG510_ME_TCT.gda in the assignment3_data/CA folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine Neighbors and Global Spatial Autocorrelation in GeoDa\nOne of the first things that we often ask about the spatial variation in our data is, “considering all the observations (values), is the overall pattern clustered, random, or dispersed?”. We use global spatial autocorrelation metrics to answer this question. To perform this analysis, we need to first define neighbors for each observation (because autocorrelation operations require comparing each observation’s value to the value of its neighbors).\n\nTo define spatial neighbors, click the Weights button on the toolbar (the big W) or navigate in the top menu to Tools | Weights Manager. In the Weights Manager popup window, click Create (since we don’t have any created yet). Choose geoid as the Weights File ID Variable – this is what will link the values in the weights matrix back to the original spatial data layer. For this set of weights, we will use Queen contiguity and only consider 1st order neighbors (Order of contiguity = 1). Make sure these parameters are selected in the Weights File Creation popup window and choose Create. When prompted, save the weights file as CA_TCT_ME_2015_Queen.gal in assignment3_data/CA. Close the “weights” popup windows when complete. NOTE: Because some of the tracts do not have any contiguous neighbors, you should get a warning stating this. This is okay.\nCalculate Moran’s I with GeoDa. To do this, in the top menu, click on Space | Univariate Moran’s I. Choose PME15R as the variable, as we are testing the spatial pattern of the rates of medical exemptions. Make sure CA_TCT_ME_2015_Queen.gal is selected for the weights. Click OK. NOTE: Because some of the tracts do not have any contiguous neighbors, you should get a warning stating this. This is okay.\nNothing really exciting should happen other than a popup window containing a Moran’s I scatterplot with the Moran’s I value at the top. To run a hypothesis test (and get a p-value) comparing the results to a null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness (CSR), right click anywhere inside the Moran’s I window and choose Randomization | 999 Permutations. You should get another popup window that contains the pseudo p-value based on the value of your data compared to the random permutations. Click Run and things will change slightly – this is due to the random element in the permutation approach. Jot down the I value, the E[I] value, and pseudo p- value and close this window.\n\n\nExpectation of normal distribution\nOne nice thing that GeoDa does is not “expect” that your data are normally distributed, and thus uses a permutation approach (randomly shuffle the values in space and calculate the statistic many times) to generate pseudo p-values rather than a Z-score based formula.\n\n\n\nQuestion #4: Provide the three values from Step 16 and a quick description of each (proving to me that you understand what each means). Use the output to briefly answer (in 3-4 sentences), Are PME Rates in 2015 in California spatially clustered? Are these results important? (hint, examine the magnitude of the Moran’s I value)\n\nNow, you will conduct a similar test, but use an alternate neighbor definition. Doing this is hugely important for any spatial analysis, as it serves as a sensitivity test. Basically, it helps you determine whether your results are simply a result of the particular neighbor definition.\n\nRedo Step 17, but define neighbors as 10 Nearest Neighbors (look for k-Nearest Neighbors) without Inverse distance. Save the file as CA_TCT_ME_2015_10NN.gwt.\n\n21. Redo Steps 18 and 19, but use CA_TCT_ME_2015_10NN.gwt for the weights.\n\n\n\nQuestion #5: Provide the three values from Step 21. Briefly describe (in 3-4 sentences) whether/how the change in neighbor definition affected the Moran’s I results. Were the results sensitive to the neighbor definition (and why do you think that)?\n\n\n\n\nLocal Spatial Autocorrelation in GeoDa\nGlobal spatial autocorrelation methods only provide a single value for our entire dataset. But, we often want to understand if the spatial pattern is clustered, random, dispersed at a local or regional level. We use local spatial autocorrelation metrics (e.g., LISA, Getis Ord G*) to accomplish this. These methods produce a measure of autocorrelation for each observation in your data, thus allowing you to identify hotspots and coldspots (ugh… clusters of high values and low values), as well as outlier values.\n\nFor this exercise, we will calculate LISA with GeoDa. To do this, in the top menu, click on Space | Univariate Local Moran’s I. Choose PME15R as the variable, as we are testing the spatial pattern of the rates of medical exemptions. Make sure CA_TCT_ME_2015_Queen.gal is selected for the weights. Click OK. You will get a popup window asking “What windows to open?”. Make sure that all options are selected and click OK.\nThe Moran’s I scatterplot should look very familiar to you, as this is the exact same output from the global Moran’s I test we ran earlier. You can close this window. You will also see two maps: 1) the LISA results showing observations by category: High-High (hotspot), Low-Low (coldspot), Low- High (low outlier), High-Low (high outlier), and Neighborless (No Data) and 2) the significance associated with the LISA results for all observations (based on 999 permutations). Note that only observations that were significant at a level of p &lt; 0.05 are highlighted in the categorical map.\nSave the results of the GeoDa LISA analysis to the attribute table of CA_TCT_ME_2015 by right clicking inside the LISA results window and selecting Save Results. Make sure that all outputs are selected, and then choose OK. Permanently save the LISA results to the file (see note above).\nSave your project and exit GeoDa.\n\nGeoDa is not a production-quality mapping software, in any way shape or form. It is fen for exploratory mapping or sharing maps among colleagues, but it should not be used to create maps for dissertations/theses/articles. Later in this lab, you will be tasked with creating a map of the GeoDa output.\n\n\n\nSpatial Clustering in SaTScan\nThe theory behind clustering in SaTScan is a bit different than how we conceptualize clustering when using spatial autocorrelation. SaTScan searches through the data and identifies sets of neighboring observations that, in combination, demonstrate high or low risk compared to the overall risk in the study region. In spatial autocorrelation analysis, we are simply looking at the similarity in values among neighboring regions.\nSaTScan is a spatial clustering software… no more and no less. It does that one function extremely well, and really does not do much of anything else. When working with your own data, you may have to do some wrangling of the data in another software before it is SaTScan ready. Thankfully, it will read shapefiles though!\n\nOpen SaTScan and choose Create New Session. You should get a window with three tabs, Input, Analysis, and Output. We will actually start on the Analysis tab. For this exercise, we are working with cross-sectional data, so we will be performing a Purely Spatial Analysis. Our probability model is Poisson because we are working with medical exemptions, which are a medical condition that should be randomly distributed in the population of incoming kindergarteners (and thus be randomly spatially distributed). In this case, we want to scan for clusters having High or Low Rates. Click on the Advanced button and navigate to the Spatial Window tab. This is where you can set the “maximum” spatial size of the identified clusters and can choose between Circular and Elliptic cluster shapes. For this analysis, we will keep things simple and leave them on their default values, but knowing where to change these values is important. Click Close.\nClick the Input tab. Here we have to import a Case File. We will use the .dbf file (attribute table) of CA_TCT_ME_2015 (same data we worked with earlier, but saved in a different file format). Click the button with the three little dots for Case File, navigate to assignment3_data/CA/shp, and select CA_TCT_ME_2015.dbf. You will now hold SaTScan’s hand and assign the proper fields in the .dbf file to SaTScan’s required format. Click Next. In the popup window:\n\n\nClick on the word “unassigned” to the right of Location ID and choose GEOID. This is basically defining unique IDs for each feature (this is important for linking together all the observations “inside” of SaTScan, and to be able to link the results from SaTScan back to the layer for mapping in ArcMap).\nClick on the word “unassigned” to the right of Number of Cases and choose PME15. We choose this variable because SaTScan uses the count data! Click Next, then click Next again.\nSave the imported input file as PME15_cases.cas in assignment3_data/CA. Click Import.\n\n\nClick the button with the three little dots for Population File, navigate to assignment3_data/CA/shp, and select CA_TCT_ME_2015.dbf. Click Next. Choose GEOID for the Location ID and ENR15 for the Population. Leave everything else unassigned. Click Next. Save the imported input file as ENR15_population.pop in assignment3_data/CA. Click Import.\nClick the button with the three little dots for Coordinates File, navigate to assignment3_data/CA/shp, and select CA_TCT_ME_2015_geocentroids.shp. SaTScan loves working with geographic point data, so this is a file with geographic centroids of the tract polygons from earlier – I created this file in QGIS prior to the analysis for you. Click Next. Choose GEOID for the Location ID, Longitude / X for X, and Latitude / Y for Y. Leave everything else unassigned. Click Next. Save the imported input file as CA_TCT_coords.geo in assignment3_data/CA. Click Import.\nIMPORTANT: Change the top option (Display SaTScan Variables For) to Cartesian (x,y) Coordinates. We do this because this data layer is projected in a Cartesian (projected) coordinate system and we want SaTScan to know this to use the proper formulas for distance calculations. Leave everything else on the Input tab on the defaults.\n\n\nNeighbors in SaTScan\nBy default, SaTScan uses Euclidean distance to define spatial neighbors (in the scan window). However, you can provide non-distance based neighbors by clicking on the Advanced button in the Input tab, clicking on the Spatial Neighbors tab, and providing a Non-Euclidean neighbors file (you will have to research the format this file is in, as I have never done this!).\n\n\n\nClick on the Output tab. Write the Main Results File to TCT_PME_Scan_Clusters.txt in assignment3_data/CA. Make sure the little boxes are selected for dBase for Cluster Information and Location Information. One odd thing about SaTScan is that if you are working in Cartesian Coordinates, it will not allow you to write out a shapefile of the cluster output. However, we can easily create a spatial data layer afterwards using the dBase files in QGIS. To run SaTScan, click the little green triangle button (near the top of the main SaTScan window). Another way to do this is to go to the top menu and choose Session execute.\nWhen SaTScan is done, TCT_PME_Scan_Clusters.txt will pop up. This file contains some basic information about the input data and resulting clusters, as well as the members of and statistics for each cluster. Scroll to the top and note the nature of the output. In this case, we want to map our output, so we will be working in QGIS to do that. See the SaTScan Users Guide for more detailed information about the potential output options and what is included in each file. Prior to closing SaTScan, save your session in assignment3_data/CA.\n\n\n\n\nCreate Mappable Data from SaTScan Output using QGIS\nThe first thing we will do is create a spatial data layer representing the spatial extent of the clusters in QGIS. Remember, a cluster in SaTScan is a collection of observations, but showing the extent of a cluster can be useful for visualization/comparative purposes.\n33. Open QGIS and create a new project. Add CA_TCT_ME_2015.gpkg.\n\nAdd TCT_PME_Scan_Clusters.col.dbf to the QGIS Layers panel (you can drag/drop). This file contains information about the center, size, and statistical attributes of each of the clusters identified in SaTScan. First, we will create a temporary point layer of the cluster centers. In the Processing Toolbox, navigate to Vector creation | Create points layer from table. For the Input layer choose TCT_PME_Scan_Clusters.col. Select the appropriate fields for X (X) and Y (Y), and make sure that the CRS is EPSG:3310 click OK. These are the center points of the clusters.\nIn the following steps, you will use a variable distance Buffer to create spatial representations of the extent of each cluster. However, you should open the attribute table of the “Points from table” file first. Do this and look in the RADIUS field. Notice that some of the entries have 0 radius? Now, look in the NUMBER_LOC field and you will see that these are “single observation” clusters. We will not include these in our map (and, we do not want to attempt to create a 0 distance buffer from points!).\nUse an attribute query to select only points with a RADIUS greater than 0.\n\n\n\nQuestion #6: How many total clusters did SatScan identify? How many of those clusters contained more than one observation?\n\n\nOnce the features are selected, navigate to Vector | Geoprocessing Tools | Buffer. For Input layer, choose the “Points from table” file. Make sure that Selected features only is checked! For Distance, click the little button all the way to the right (next to the word meters) and choose Field type: … | RADIUS (this is the variable distance!). Leave everything else on the default value (including Dissolve result), and then click Run. Because you had only a subset of features in your “Events” layer selected, the buffers should have only been created for those features. Change the symbology so that the buffer polygons do not have a fill (Fill Style = No Brush).\nRemember that we chose to scan for High or Low clusters in SaTScan? Now, create separate layers for the buffers of High Relative Risk and Low Relative Risk clusters. You can do this using the REL_RISK field in the buffer output. Any cluster with a relative risk less than 1 is “Low” and any greater than 1 is “High”. Use attribute queries and then export the features into separate layers stored in assignment3_data/CA. Turn off the original buffer layer after you have created the new High and Low layers.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #7: Of the clusters with more than one observation, how many were “Low” and how many were “High”?\n\n\nInstall and activate the “Select Within” plugin. Go to Vector | Select Within | Select Within. Use this tool to select and then export the tracts from falling within the 1) high clusters and 2) low clusters (separately). You are selecting from CA_TCT_ME_2015; use the Centroid option. We use this selection method because centroids are what were used to define the clusters in SaTScan! Once you have the tracts selected, save them as new layers in assignment3_data/CA (make sure to distinguish between “high” and “low”).\nMake two maps that contain the results of the LISA (local autocorrelation) result from GeoDa and the SaTScan results. We will say that this map layout is for “internal” purposes and your audience knows California very well. Some guidance is below, as well as an (incomplete) example.\n\n\nFor map elements, only include the map data, legend, and title (that clearly distinguishes which results came from which method).\nAlthough this in an internal map, the two maps should be the exact same size… and have the exact same extent!\nUse a similar category/color scheme to GeoDa for your maps. For the GeoDa output, there should be a field with values that range from 0 to 5 (the default name that GeoDa gives this field is LISA_CL). The correspondence is as such, 1: High-High, 2: Low-Low, 3: Low-High, 4: High-Low, 5: No neighbors, and 0: Nonsignifcant results.\nFor the SaTScan map, include both the tracts within the clusters and the cluster extents. Include both High and Low clusters. Make sure that your order of layers is (from the bottom): Low Polygons, High Polygons, Low Circle, High Circle.\nUse similar colors to map high and low results between the two methods.\nUse CA_state.gpkg as a background layer because not all tracts had a school in California\nFor this map, you have to use the transparency method for the tract borders!\nMake sure to save your QGIS project file(s). Export the map as a .pdf file using the userid_assignment3_map2.pdf.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #8: Compare the output of the SaTScan and LISA analysis. Briefly describe (50-100 words) similarities and differences. In 3-5 sentences, explain why would we “expect” them to produce somewhat different results. Refer to your readings: CM Chapter 5, and the Sabel reading for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nUpload your answer document (userid_assignment3.docx).\nUpload your 2 maps (pdf files)"

If you want to follow along, you can download the data here.\nNote that throughout this document, if I use the term “right click,” this means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nOpen QGIS\n\nOpen a new project in QGIS.\n\n\n\nLandScan Imagery\n\nLandScan imagery for population distribution is available here. However, for this demonstration I have already downloaded the 2021 population distribution data for you. For this demo, we are interested in looking population distribution for Richland County, SC.\n\n\n\nClip Raster Layer\n\nAdd the landscan-usa-2021-conus-day.tif to your QGIS project. This contains the day-time population count for each pixel.\nAdd richland_bg.gpkg to your QGIS project and accept any transformations.\nClip the landscan layer to the area of interest bounds, which is Richland County. Navigate in the top menu to Raster | Extraction | Clip Raster by Mask Layer. For the Input layer choose the landscan layer. For the Mask layer choose richland county block groups. Leave everything else unchanged (this will create a temporary output layer called Clipped (mask)). To ensure no confusion layer, rename this temporary layer to daypop.\nTurn off the original landscan layer and give the new temporary layer a different color ramp that makes sense.\n\n\n\nBasemaps in QGIS\n\nTo provide more context to your analysis, you can also add freely available basemaps to QGIS.

To make “apples to apples” comparison, it is important that your rasters are in the same color scheme and classes. You can do so easily by “transferring styles” from one layer to the other. Simply right click on the daytime population layer | Styles | Copy Style. Then right click on the nighttime population layer | Styles | Paste Style.\nFinally we will calculate the difference between daytime and nighttime populations for each pixel. To do so go to Processing | Raster Analysis | Raster Calculator (not the virtual one). In the raster calculator, select the 2 input layers, and use a subtraction expression to subtract nighttime populations from daytime populations. Save as a temporary layer. This raster calculator is a very powerful tool for calculations linked to raster overlay.\n\n\n\nZonal Statistics\n\nIn many analysis, we want to get information from raster data, and then assign it to vector data. In this case, we want to calculate the nighttime population for each census block group in Richland County. To do so, go to Processing | Raster Analysis | Zonal Statistics. Provide the Richland BG polygon file as input layer, and the nighttime population file as raster. Statistics to Calculate can be as it is. Create temporary layer.\nTake a look at the Zonal Statistic layer and examine the distribution of the population."

    "text": "Part #1: Regression Analysis of Hospital Utilization Rates\nIn this analysis, you will be exploring the underlying factors that affect variations in hospital utilization (at a Zip Code level) in Michigan. This question (and data) is a streamlined/simplified version of one of the research questions from my dissertation research. My main question was whether the availability of hospital beds (measured as spatial accessibility) affected hospital utilization while controlling for other factors that could also affect variation in hospital utilization. You will be walking through a multiple spatial regression analysis in GeoDa to help answer this.\n\n\nImport data and Interpolation\n\nOpen QGIS and add the mi_zip_util layer from the MI_Zip_Util.gpkg in your assignment5_data folder. NOTE: the next steps might take a bit of time. GeoDa can save your work in a Project file. It might be a good idea to create one and save as you go.\nOpen the attribute table to view the fields included in the data layer. They are defined as follows:\n\nCL895: The ID associated with each observation. Some of the Zip Codes in MI were grouped with neighboring Zip Codes prior to the analysis (this was a data issue in the hospitalization data), so they do not have traditional Zip Code numbers. However, this is ultimately Zip Code level data.\nAAPDr: The Age-adjusted Patient Day rate. This is our dependent (Y) variable. This is total days spent in the hospital for residents of each Zip Code divided by the total number of residents in each Zip Code. The values were then age-adjusted using an indirect standardization approach.\nPOP: The total Population of each Zip Code.\nE2SFCA: The measure of spatial accessibility (or availability) of hospital beds available to residents of each region. It is called the Enhanced 2 Step Floating Catchment Area metric, and its calculation integrates supply (hospital beds), potential demand (Population), and the distance separating supply and demand locations. Higher values indicate higher spatial accessibility (availability). We will cover this metric in more detail later in our course.\nHINS0064: The proportion of the Population aged 0-64 that has some form of health insurance. This age group is often used for health insurance because, theoretically, everyone in the US over the age of 65 has health insurance via Medicare.\nEDBApl: The proportion of the Population aged 25 and above that has a bachelor’s degree or higher.\nFEMPCT: The proportion of the Population that is female.\nWHITEPCT: The proportion of the Population that is white.\nPOPDENS: The Population density in units of people per km2.\n\n\nPrior to performing any multiple regression, we should check for correlation among our independent variables (unless the model you are using specifically accounts for this). If there is correlation present, our independent variables aren’t truly “independent” and will cause issues in the results (called multicollinearity). We can evaluate the potential for multicollinearity prior to regression by calculating the Pearson’s R of the variables, or we can evaluate it after the regression by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF) of each variable.\n\n\nThere are a number of “rules of thumb” for what is an allowable level of multicollinearity in a regression model (discussed in Lecture #26). I tend to use both Pearson’s R and VIF. My own personal rules of thumb are much more strict than others I’ve seen in the literature. Personally, I only feel truly comfortable including X variables in a model that have a pairwise Pearson’s R value of less than 0.5 and/or a VIF value of less than 2. However, I let these stretch somewhat depending on each project… e.g., I may let a variable in with values slightly higher than my thresholds… and I just deal with being somewhat uncomfortable about it.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson’s R values (Correlation_matrix.csv) and the VIF values (VIF_values.csv) for the potential independent variables are included in the assignment5_data folder folder. The R code I used to do these calculations is named Assess_multicollinearity.R and is located in the code folder. Examine the Pearson’s R and VIF values for all models and use them to answer the following question.\n\n\n\nQuestion #1: Dr. D decided that you will use the following independent variables in your regression analysis – POP, E2SFCA, HINS0064, EDBApl, FEMPCT, WHITEPCT. In 3-5 sentences, explain how he came to this decision and point out instances (specifically, tell which variables or which model) in which he disregarded his personal rules of thumb (use NOTE above).\n\n\nYou can now close the correlation matrix and VIF tables. Navigate back to GeoDa (with MI_Zip_Util.gpkg loaded). When working with spatial data and regression in GeoDa, in order to evaluate whether the residuals of a regression model are spatially autocorrelated, you must first define the neighbors and their weights. Click on Tools | Weights Manager or click the “W” button on the main menu bar. Click Create. Use CL895 as the ID Variable. Use Queen contiguity for the weights. Name them MI_ZIP_Util_queen.gal and store in the assignment5_data folder. After you create the weights, you can close the Weights Manager.\nYou will now perform a regular OLS regression, which will also provide you diagnostic information about whether or not you should use a spatial regression model. In the top menu, click Regression | Regression or click the REG button on the main menu bar. In the dialog box, add AAPDr as the Dependent Variable. Add the variables from Question #1 (only) as the Covariates. Make sure MI_ZIP_Util.gal is selected as the Weights File. In the Models area, make sure that Classic is selected. Click Run.\nReview the Regression output, which should appear in a new window called Regression Report. Some things of note, the model is significant [Prob(F-statistic)]; the coefficients are all significant except for POP; uh oh… the Multicollinearity Condition Number (MCN) is extremely high (much higher than the recommendation of 30). Go back to the Regression window and remove HINS0064 from the covariates, then click Run. Note the MCN value is still too high. Now, remove FEMPCT from the covariates, then click Run.\n\n\nThere are a number of ways to deal with (X) variables that are causing multicollinearity in a regression model. Removal of variables from the model is just one of them. In this case, I determined which variables to remove (to get a decent MCN) via a trial and error process and examination of the bivariate correlation matrix. However, other solutions are Stepwise Regression (automated variable removal), Principal Components Analysis (to extract “components” that capture the variation in a set of X variables), and others.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #2: What was the Multicollinearity Condition Number for the 2nd and 3rd OLS regressions from Step 7?\n\n\nNow, we have a model that meets our requirement of independent X variables. Now, let’s examine whether the residuals have spatial autocorrelation. Scroll down in the regression output and look for DIAGNOSTICS FOR SPATIAL DEPENDENCE. Here you will find the Moran’s I test of the regression residuals.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #3: Do you need to run a spatial regression? [the answer is Yes]. In 2-3 sentences, explain why this is the case (using evidence from the OLS output).\n\n\n\nQuestion #4: Copy/paste the summary results of your 3rd OLS regression from Step 7 into your lab document. Make sure that the font stays as Courier!\n\n\n\nQuestion #5: Which type of spatial regression model should you run based on a) theory and b) the diagnostics (see lecture slides or GeoDa handbook). Provide 1-3 sentences for each. Keep in mind that hospitalizations are not contagious.\n\n\nIn the regression window, change from a Classic model to a Spatial Error model. Click Run. Examine the results in the Regression Report window. The output we will focus on is AIC (Akaike info criterion). Note that the AIC value -1,249.99 is lower than the AIC value from the OLS model -945.992 indicating a better model fit. Also, note that Lambda (the spatial error coefficient) is highly significant.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #6: Copy/paste the summary results of Spatial Error model into your lab document. Make sure that the font stays as Courier!\n\n\n\nQuestion #7: Describe how the coefficient values changed in the spatial error model (compared to the 3rd OLS model). Are the effect sizes bigger/smaller? Is there anything notable that changed in the significance of the coefficients?\n\n\nWrite the predicted values, the residuals, and prediction errors from your spatial error model to your attribute table by clicking on the Save to Table button in the Regression window (keep the default names). After you have saved the values to your table, run a Moran’s I on the residuals by navigating to Space | Univariate Moran’s I in the top menu. Choose ERR_RESIDU as the variable.\n\n\nWhile writing this assignment, I found out that the authors of GeoDa say that generating a pseudo P-value for the Moran’s I results of regression residuals is not an acceptable approach. I honestly have no idea why this is. Thus, to evaluate remaining spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, we will use the magnitude of the Moran’s I value, rather than the pseudo P-value.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #8: What is the Moran’s I value of the residuals from the Spatial Error model? Is this a small/medium/large amount of remaining spatial autocorrelation?\n\n\nNow, run a Spatial Lag regression model using the same set of variables. In the Regression window, change to a Spatial Lag model and click Run. Save the results to your attribute table. The spatial lag parameter is Rho, which is identified as W_AAPDr in the output.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #9: Copy/paste the summary results of Spatial Lag model into your lab document. Make sure that the font stays as Courier!\n\n\n\nQuestion #10: Based on AIC, which model (Spatial Lag or Spatial Error) fits the observed hospitalization data better? (See Step #9 on AIC interpretation)\n\n\n\nQuestion #11: What is the Moran’s I value of the residuals of the Spatial Lag model? Is this a small/medium/large amount of remaining spatial autocorrelation?\n\n\nUnfortunately, similar to many health-related models that use observed data, the residuals from both the spatial error and lag models both fail the tests of normality and heteroscedasticity. This is extremely common with ecological (aggregated) spatial data. In this case, we will assume that these violations do not undermine our ability to make inference from the results of the model.\n\n\nExtra Credit Opportunity: Figure out in GeoDa how to create a histogram of your regression residuals to evaluate normality and and a scatterplot to evaluate heteroscedasticity in the residuals. Paste the graphics directly into your assignment document. Make sure that the graphics are large enough that I can evaluate that you have plotted the correct values.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #12: Going back to the original research question, does the availability of hospital beds affect hospital utilization (while controlling for other factors)? What is the direction of this relationship? Use the output of your regression analysis to justify/explain your answer (limit your explanation to the analysis we performed).\n\n\nSave your project and close GeoDa."

NOTE: the next steps might take a bit of time. GeoDa can save your work in a Project file. It might be a good idea to create one and save as you go.\nOpen the attribute table to view the fields included in the data layer. They are defined as follows:\n\nCL895: The ID associated with each observation. Some of the Zip Codes in MI were grouped with neighboring Zip Codes prior to the analysis (this was a data issue in the hospitalization data), so they do not have traditional Zip Code numbers. However, this is ultimately Zip Code level data.\nAAPDr: The Age-adjusted Patient Day rate. This is our dependent (Y) variable. This is total days spent in the hospital for residents of each Zip Code divided by the total number of residents in each Zip Code. The values were then age-adjusted using an indirect standardization approach.\nPOP: The total Population of each Zip Code.\nE2SFCA: (MAIN X VARIABLE) The measure of spatial accessibility (or availability) of hospital beds available to residents of each region. It is called the Enhanced 2 Step Floating Catchment Area metric, and its calculation integrates supply (hospital beds), potential demand (Population), and the distance separating supply and demand locations. Higher values indicate higher spatial accessibility (availability). We will cover this metric in more detail later in our course.\nHINS0064: The proportion of the Population aged 0-64 that has some form of health insurance. This age group is often used for health insurance because, theoretically, everyone in the US over the age of 65 has health insurance via Medicare.\nEDBApl: The proportion of the Population aged 25 and above that has a bachelor’s degree or higher.\nFEMPCT: The proportion of the Population that is female.\nWHITEPCT: The proportion of the Population that is white.\nPOPDENS: The Population density in units of people per km2.\n\nPrior to performing any multiple regression, we should check for correlation among our independent variables (unless the model you are using specifically accounts for this). If there is correlation present, our independent variables aren’t truly “independent” and will cause issues in the results (called multicollinearity). We can evaluate the potential for multicollinearity prior to regression by calculating the Pearson’s R of the variables, or we can evaluate it after the regression by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF) of each variable.\n\n\nThere are a number of “rules of thumb” for what is an allowable level of multicollinearity in a regression model (discussed in Lecture #21). I tend to use both Pearson’s R and VIF. My own personal rules of thumb are much more strict than others I’ve seen in the literature. Personally, I only feel truly comfortable including X variables in a model that have a pairwise Pearson’s R value of less than 0.5 and/or a VIF value of less than 2. However, I let these stretch somewhat depending on each project, especially if there is strong justification and theory behind the variable.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson’s R values (Correlation_matrix.csv) and the VIF values (VIF_values.csv) for the potential independent variables are included in the GEOG510_assignment4_data folder folder. The R code I used to do these calculations is named Assess_multicollinearity.R and is located in the code folder. Examine the Pearson’s R and VIF values for all models and use them to answer the following question.\n\n\n\nQuestion #1: Dr. Goel decided that you will use the following independent variables in your regression analysis – POP, E2SFCA, HINS0064, EDBApl, FEMPCT, WHITEPCT. In 3-5 sentences, explain how he came to this decision and point out instances (specifically, tell which variables or which model) in which he disregarded his personal rules of thumb (use NOTE above).\n\n\nYou can now close the correlation matrix and VIF tables. Navigate back to GeoDa (with MI_Zip_Util.gpkg loaded). When working with spatial data and regression in GeoDa, in order to evaluate whether the residuals of a regression model are spatially autocorrelated, you must first define the neighbors and their weights. Click on Tools | Weights Manager or click the “W” button on the main menu bar. Click Create. Use CL895 (zipcode equivalent) as the ID Variable. Use Queen contiguity for the weights. Name them MI_ZIP_Util_queen.gal and store in the GEOG510_assignment4_data folder. After you create the weights, you can close the Weights Manager.\nYou will now perform a regular OLS regression, which will also provide you diagnostic information about whether or not you should use a spatial regression model. In the top menu, click Regression | Regression or click the REG button on the main menu bar. In the dialog box, add AAPDr as the Dependent Variable. Add the variables from Question #1 (only) as the Covariates. Make sure MI_ZIP_Util.gal is selected as the Weights File. In the Models area, make sure that Classic is selected. Click Run.\nReview the Regression output, which should appear in a new window called Regression Report. Some things of note, the model is significant [Prob(F-statistic)]; the coefficients are all significant except for POP; uh oh… the Multicollinearity Condition Number (MCN) is extremely high (much higher than the recommendation of 30). Go back to the Regression window and remove HINS0064 from the covariates, then click Run. Note the MCN value is still too high. Now, remove FEMPCT from the covariates, then click Run.\n\n\nThere are a number of ways to deal with (X) variables that are causing multicollinearity in a regression model. Removal of variables from the model is just one of them. In this case, I determined which variables to remove (to get a decent MCN) via a trial and error process and examination of the bivariate correlation matrix. However, other solutions are Stepwise Regression (automated variable removal), Principal Components Analysis (to extract “components” that capture the variation in a set of X variables), and others. Another method that I use a lot is to rely on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to get a set of minimum confounders to include in the model. The DAGs rely a lot on theory and are a cornerstone of epidemiological research. Please let me know if you need more information/resources especially for your final projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #2: What was the Multicollinearity Condition Number for the 2nd and 3rd OLS regressions from Step 7?\n\n\nNow, we have a model that meets our requirement of independent X variables. Now, let’s examine whether the residuals have spatial autocorrelation. Scroll down in the regression output and look for DIAGNOSTICS FOR SPATIAL DEPENDENCE. Here you will find the Moran’s I test of the regression residuals.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #3: Do you need to run a spatial regression? [the answer is Yes]. In 2-3 sentences, explain why this is the case (using evidence from the OLS output).\n\n\n\nQuestion #4: Copy/paste the summary results of your 3rd OLS regression from Step 7 into your lab document. Make sure that the font stays as Courier!\n\n\n\nQuestion #5: Which type of spatial regression model should you run based on a) theory and b) the diagnostics (see lecture slides or GeoDa handbook). Provide 1-3 sentences for each. Keep in mind that hospitalizations are not contagious.\n\n\nIn the regression window, change from a Classic model to a Spatial Error model. Click Run. Examine the results in the Regression Report window. The output we will focus on is AIC (Akaike info criterion). Note that the AIC value -1,249.99 is lower than the AIC value from the OLS model -945.992 indicating a better model fit. Also, note that Lambda (the spatial error coefficient) is highly significant.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #6: Copy/paste the summary results of Spatial Error model into your lab document. Make sure that the font stays as Courier!\n\n\n\nQuestion #7: Describe how the coefficient values changed in the spatial error model (compared to the 3rd OLS model). Are the effect sizes bigger/smaller? Is there anything notable that changed in the significance of the coefficients?\n\n\nWrite the predicted values, the residuals, and prediction errors from your spatial error model to your attribute table by clicking on the Save to Table button in the Regression window (keep the default names). After you have saved the values to your table, run a Moran’s I on the residuals by navigating to Space | Univariate Moran’s I in the top menu. Choose ERR_RESIDU as the variable.\n\n\nWhile writing this assignment, I found out that the authors of GeoDa say that generating a pseudo P-value for the Moran’s I results of regression residuals is not an acceptable approach. Thus, to evaluate remaining spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, we will use the magnitude of the Moran’s I value, rather than the pseudo P-value.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #8: What is the Moran’s I value of the residuals from the Spatial Error model? Is this a small/medium/large amount of remaining spatial autocorrelation?\n\n\nNow, run a Spatial Lag regression model using the same set of variables. In the Regression window, change to a Spatial Lag model and click Run. Save the results to your attribute table. The spatial lag parameter is Rho, which is identified as W_AAPDr in the output.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #9: Copy/paste the summary results of Spatial Lag model into your lab document. Make sure that the font stays as Courier!\n\n\n\nQuestion #10: Based on AIC, which model (Spatial Lag or Spatial Error) fits the observed hospitalization data better? (See Step #9 on AIC interpretation)\n\n\n\nQuestion #11: What is the Moran’s I value of the residuals of the Spatial Lag model? Is this a small/medium/large amount of remaining spatial autocorrelation?\n\n\nUnfortunately, similar to many health-related models that use observed data, the residuals from both the spatial error and lag models both fail the tests of normality and heteroscedasticity. This is extremely common with ecological (aggregated) spatial data. In this case, we will assume that these violations do not undermine our ability to make inference from the results of the model.\n\n\nExtra Credit Opportunity: 10 points Figure out in GeoDa how to create a histogram of your regression residuals to evaluate normality and and a scatterplot to evaluate heteroscedasticity in the residuals. Paste the graphics directly into your assignment document. Make sure that the graphics are large enough that I can evaluate that you have plotted the correct values.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion #12: Going back to the original research question, does the availability of hospital beds affect hospital utilization (while controlling for other factors)? What is the direction of this relationship? Use the output of your regression analysis to justify/explain your answer (limit your explanation to the analysis we performed).\n\n\nSave your project and close GeoDa."

    "text": "Part #2: Thinking about regression for your project question (30 points)\nWhile it is not necessary to implement a regression analysis for your final projects, regression can be a powerful tool to test hypotheses related to spatial processes driving the observed spatial patterns of your health outcoome. In this part, you are asked to conceptualize what a regression analysis may look like for you, so that you can more confidently implement it in your final projects if you choose to.\n\nQuestion #13: Frame your main research question in the context of an independent (x) and dependent (Y) variable. For example, my main question is to look at how does daily average temperature (X variable) impact percentage of people with mental health distress in each censusc tract of South Carolina (Y variable). Be as specific as you can so that you will have a better idea of what exact data you need to have.\n\n\nQuestion #14: Name atleast 3 potential confounders/other independent variables (other than Age, Sex, and population) that you would include in your analysis. Age, Sex, and populationare almost always variables in many health analysis, so I want you to think beyond them. Also explain why do you think they may be potential confounders to be added. Be as specific as you can so that you will have a better idea of what exact data you need to have.\n\n\nQuestion #15: Think about the potential motivation of why a spatial regression may be important for your question, in the context of 1st order and 2nd order spatial analysis. In 3-5 sentences, explain the motivation/reasoning behind why you would want to use one spatial regression and if so, which one ( or both, or not? Link your reasoning to the type of 1st order and 2nd order spatial processes that may be driving your research question for your analysis.\n\nExtra Credit Opportunity: upto 40 points I will grant upto 40 points if you actually conduct a regression analysis for your own final project data. This will be based on the sophistication and accuracy of your analysis, but even a non-horrible simple OLS regression will fetch 10 points.\n\nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask!\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nUpload your answer document to OneDrive."
